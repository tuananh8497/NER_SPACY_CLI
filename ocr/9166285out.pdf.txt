The need for a decision in this matter arose because a wholesale drug firm had approached the N.S .W. Government for permission to conduct comprehensive trials to determine whether the plant could be grown commercially in that State.
The following reasons were considered to be valid in .Experteze had been achieved in improving commercial strains of the plant by a company operating in Tasmania.
This proposal was agreed to by all States.

Several other aspects of Opium Poppy growing were .Licencing of growers by the Department of Customs security in transfer of harvested material to the .The importation of seed in fertile condition.
These matters were of no real concern to this Department.
However, apart from the general aspects of controlling the growth of the Opium Poppy as a drug plant, it is considered desirable for such a small agricultural industry to be restricted to a given area.
In the light of present needs the total acreage required would be approximately 5,000 acres.

Other States are in the process of introducing similar regulations.
As an added safeguard chemists were requested to reduce their stocks of dangerous drugs to a minimum.
Chemists are co-operating and significant quantities of surplus and obsolete stocks are being handed in to the State Bealth Departments for destruction.

The folloming major recommendations arose out of the working party's inspections and deliberations: wholesalers or manufacturers and lodged, the supplier should replace the deteriorated stock on a one-for one basis and claim the old stock for supervised destruction at a later date.
Additional work is still to be undertaken and a further report mill be made in due course.

He considered that the important matters to be questions which members missed to put to Sir William.
National Archives of Australia Det. Sgt, Abbott said that he would like to make it clear to Sir William that education was not the role in combatting the drug problem.
Thile the Committee wens very conscious of the part that education mould play in the future, he considered it that it was necessary to work as a team and that other avenues also had to be supported.
He asked Sir William what age group in the schools the Sub- Committee was directing its education Sir Milliam stated that it was the intention to aim the programme at the Secondary School level.
He said that in Americe it mass aimed as low as the 10-12 age group, but at this stage it mass intended to keep mainly at the secondary school level.
He also said that he mass aware that education mass only one segment of a big problem which also included enforcement, and treatment and rehabilitation of addicts.

In doing so the length of the course mould need to be borne in mind.
However he considered that it would perhaps be better to wait until the current course finished so that it could .
Hienholt advised that a report on the course would be made to the Education Sub Committee which would in turn pass it to this Committee.
He said the idee of the Course was to train personnel so that they mould return to their home States to train other people.
If the States felt that their mon training programmes mere adequate there would be no need to hold future courses of this nature.

The aide replied that there was one further approach and that undertaking that funds mould continue for the duration of the study.
He said that no such guarantee could be given since if there was a cut back in the grant from the Commonwealth some of the projects in the States may rate a higher priority.
He suggested that if money was available from this year'gs funds the whole amount should be allocated to the project.
He said that itmas impotent to be able measure and assess the results of projets undertaken.
In view of the difficult nature of this task he said he would support the proposal.
He then asked whether dean assurance could be given that the level of spending of this year's funds mould continue confident that funds mould be availhle to alley for continuation of eristic proposals.
He then put the proposition to the meeting.
The Chairman commented that the education Sub Committee had reported requests received from the States for 1971/72.

The following objectives were recommended for a National Programme in relation to the States and Territories: (ii) to provide support and also complement State programmes, Prior to the establishment of the Drug Education Sub Committee, the need for training coulees had been stressed and two seminars on effective techniques for drug education personnel had been conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Health.
Recognising that there was still a paucity of trained personnel, the Drug Education Sub -Committee recommended that a training course of sir months' duration be held for people who were undertaking a leadership role in State programmes.
Arrangements have been made for this course to commence on 24 February in Sydney at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.
Further supportive and complementary activities recommended by the Sub Committee were: the various educational techniques used in the community concerning drugs, and the methods of evaluation, (ivy the encouragement of research into the most satisfactory way of teaching about the drug problem in schools.

Officials of the American National Council on Alcoholism, claim that when parents drink in a cultured atmosphere, as part of a ritual and not just for fun or for the stimulating or mind- deadening effects, their children seldom become dependent on alcohol.
Studies made both in Australia and abroad have shorn that children raised in a home where adults, including parents drink purely for the pleasurable likely to follow their pattern and become either alcoholics or drug dependent.
The role of the parent as a model in this, as in other forms of behaviour, is obvious.
National Archives of Australia National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence.
Conference on Psychotropic Substances The Australian delegation comprised: Customs, Chairman of Delegation Australia was represented on the following committees: Australia was also represented in a number of working groups.
Dr Walshe chaired the group on the limitation of use to medical and The Conference decided that the instrument was of sufficient importance to justify it being entitled a Convention.
From the outset many delegations emphasised the need for wide National Archives of Australia acceptance of the convention.
There was a continuing atmosphere where the commonplace.
The rasult has been a convention where the provisions have been weakened when compared with those contemplated by the original draft Comments on the more significant provisions of the Convention are contained in the following paragraphs.
Schedules With the exception of theaddition of phencyclidine to change in the content of Schedules I, II and III from that which existed in the draft protocol.
As far as Schedule 4 is concerned six substances have been deleted from Schedule and one substance, phencyclidine transferred to Schedule 2. Substances deleted from Schedule 4 of the draft protocol are Chloral hydrate Paraldehyde Chlordiazepoxide The final schedules are as follows: other nonproprietary or trivial names are given only where no INN has yet been proposed.
Other non proprietary or PHENCYCLIDINE List of Substances in Schedule IV 1/ INN Other non proprietary or MEPROBAMATE SPA A proposal by Australia to have the following substances: Allobarbital referred to in the Seventeenth Report of the W.H.O.
Expert Committee as substances analogous to the substances included in Schedule III of the draft protocol, be added to either Schedule III or Schedule IV was rejected in the Technical These seven substances from the list of 30 analagous substances are available in Australia and it seemed illogical not to include them when other barbiturates with a much less abuse potential are included in Schedule IV.
In its first consideration of the Schedules the Technical Committee recommended chlordiazepoxide and diazepam for scheduling in Schedule IV but in its final deliberations some three weeks later the Technical Committee deleted the two substances from the schedule although a number of countries including Canada, Australia The Technical Committee proposed that precursors be covered by the protocol by the addition of a separate paragraph to Article This proposal was in line with the recommendation contained in the T7th Report of the W.H.0.
Expert Cemmittee on Drug Dependence However it was subsequently recommended by the Committee on Control Measures that precursors be omitted from the protocol.
Further to this the matter was raised in the Plenary and a new paragraph was added which, whilst not providing for any acts gual control of precursors under the Protocol, requires parties to apply ''such measures of supervision as may be practicable'' to substances which may be used in the illicit manufacture of Special provisions regarding the control of preparations.
There has been no significant change from the draft protocol as far as the exemption of preparatinns from some measures of control is concerned.
In the original draft a party could, under Article 2, apply a limited right of rejection of decisions of the Commission to add substances to Schedule III and IV.
On the initiative of U.S.A. a limited right of rejection now applies to additions to Schedules I and II.
Australia vigorously opposed this proposal.
Most countries supported the proposal on the grounds that: adopt the Convention, b) certain new powers had been vested in the Narcotics Central Board such as the power to require explanations from offending Parties; the right of rejection was only to be used in exceptional circumstances.
National Archives of Australia The partial right of rejection also includes the right not to require preparations for Schedule IV substances to be controlled - also opposed by Australia.
The criteria for adding new substances to the schedules was also modified.
The provisions originally contained in Article 2 The criteria are now more clearly specified but are not precisely the words preferred by Australia, eg. the inclusion of the word The Convention still maintains strict control provisions in relation to these substances.
However, on the initiative of U.K. these substances may be used for ''very limited'' medical purposes.
They may not be used for industrial purposes.
There have been some modifications in relation to the control These provisions include prescriptions, labelling prohibition of limitation for medical and scientific purposes.
These modifications are of not great significance but tend to soften the impact of the Convention.
concerned, relates to the Reservation provisions.
A new party may notify any reservation.
Such reservations may not necessarily be accepted if a number of Parties object - Australia opposed this Adoption of the Convention.
The Convention would not seem to pose any real difficulty from the point of view of its formal adoption by Australia.
Existing controls in Australia would appear to be more stringent than those required by the Convention.
As soon as Copies of the Convention are available it is proposed that the statement be prepared setting out comments on each article.
Such a document could be made available to all interested National Archives of Australia MEETING OF STATE AD COMMONWEALTH ANALYSTS Agenda Item : Opening Remarks opportunely timed to coincide with the Symposium on the Forensic Sciences.
The idea of a meeting of State and Commonwealth Analysts was originally suggested by Mr. L.G. Clark.
Its purpose is to discuss those aspects of the drug problem which concern analysts.
Agenda Item 2 : Standardisation of Analytical Procedures 2.1 There have been court cases which have demonstrated the need for preferred or recommended methods, in the absence of prescribed, legal methods.
It was pointed out here that in many cases of seizure Customs agents must lay charges under State law, because proof of importation is often difficult.
Dr. Samuel thought that in such cases the Commonwealth should pass on its information to the State police.
This is an area for Commonwealth-State cooperation.
2.2 Mr. Clark said that there was a need to rationalise analytical procedures.
It was agreed that qualitative methods are chiefly required and should be stand- favoured the development and adoption of preferred methods, but did not want 2.3 Mr. Clark suggested that methods used in the laboratories represented at the meeting, as well as comments on their efficiency, should be sent to a central clearing point.
Methods which do not work should also be reported.
Dr. Samuel suggested that the Commonwealth should start by circulating its own preferred methods for comment.
2.l Dr. Peters agreed that methods now used by the Customs Drug Section could be used as a basis.
The Customs Laboratories have decided to publish their general analytical methods in book form, the first volume to be issued shortly.
He offered this publication as a vehicle for the preferred forensic methods.
Mr. Clark thought that a separate publication was desirable.
2.5 The general Customs methods will be available to the public.
The question of the need of restrictions on forensic methods was therefore raised.
The problem could be met by classifying methods in two categories, - In the Commonwealth Public Service, secrecy is covered by the Crimes Act.
Mr. Turner pointed out that the situation in the States was loose in this regard.
It was agreed that any initial exchange of methods should be in confidence and that the confidential character should be emphasized.
2.6 Dr. Samuel stressed that chemists give evidence in court as expert witnesses.
For this reason our methods must be available to the defence if issued and admissible as prima facie evidence.
They are available to the defence.
National Archives of Australia guide for forensic drug analysis which will be flexible enough to allow chemists to cope with difficult analytical situations.
It was accepted that this guide should preface the methods for individual drugs.
A provisional priority list was then drawn up as follows: 2.8 At the conclusion of the debate the following motion was passed.
''That the Commonwealth circulate to the States the methods they are currently using for the major drugs of abuse and request that the States comment on these as to their acceptability and add any methods of their own for either these drugs or any other.''
Agenda lItem 3 : Establishment of a Central Reference Library of Authentic Substances 3.1 The need for a centre which would acquire, hold and distribute reference samples of drugs was generally conceded.
The Customs Department, which must issue the necessary licences, is ideally placed to fulfil this function.
Dr. Peters said that the Commonwealth Laboratories would be willing to import for all Government laboratories.
The need was not only for drugs of certified purity, but also for authenticated plant samples.
3.2 The drugs would be issued following official letters of request.
The relevant State licence number will have to be quoted, and all other requirements of State laws will have to be complied with.
All requests must be sent to: Department of Customs and Excise, 3.3 At the conclusion of the debate the following motion was passed.
National Archives of Australia ''That the Commonwealth act as the Central Reference Agency for authentic drugs, and that these be made available as and when Agenda Item 4 : Use of Drug Identification Kits by Police 4.1 Dr, Peters gave an outline of the uses and limitations of the kit.
The kits are clearly subject to limitations.
They are however useful because a positive result provides reasonable grounds for arrest.
Both Mr. Lecky and Mr. Turner said that spot tests carried out by police may be unreliable and lead to miscarriage of justice.
Drs Samuel said that no prosecution should be effected on the basis of tests performed with the kits.
The Customs Department has offered to distribute the kits to State police forces, and to provide one of its Chemists to demonstrate its proper use.
The offer has been accepted and Mr. Robin Barrett will visit the various States on the following dates: Sydney Adelaide Perth Hobart Brisbane Darwin Melbourne At a virtually convenient time.
It was suggested that Mr. Barrett should also visit the various Government Lab- oratories and that Chemists from the latter should attend his lectures and demy- onstrations.
The offer was accepted by all present.
The dates given above were .3
Dr. Peters then put three questions to the State Analysts: 7. Whether they are willing to receive kits themselves and maintain them, as well as those supplied to the police forces in their Statesa 2. Whether they are prepared to back them up (rise check whether seizures which have been tested by the police give the same result when tested by a Chemist, using 3. Whether they are prepared to report back the information obtained to the Customs Laboratories, perhaps on a quarterly basis.

believed that there had been some in South Australia.
Some reagents had been prepared in N.S.W. to help as a sorting out test.
Returning to the lectures to be given by the Customs Chemist, Dr, Peters said that representative samples of National Archives of Australia drugs
were available for demonstration purposes.
A number of papers on the kits and procedures for the performance of tests from the United States Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs are also available, and copies would be distributed to each of the participants.
5.1 The possibility of a meeting of ''bench'' chemists to perhaps coincide with the next forensic science symposium, was again discussed.
Mr. Clark thought however that such a meeting should be held separately since not all concerned might normally attend the symposium.
Dre Samuel suggested to leave the matter in abeyance : there may not be a need for such a meeting.
5.2 Matters on which information should be exchanged include general intelligence; materials and services relevant to forensic work which are available in the various laboratories; new drugs or new forms of drugs which appear; and research projects which are in progress in the various organisations.
The suggestion was made that the Commonwealth Laboratories were well placed to serve as the centre for such an information exchange.
Accordingly the meeting passed the following resolution: ''That the Commonwealth should act as a central agency in receiving and disseminating information from the States on technical and analytical matters relating to drugs of abuse.''
No points were raised under this item.
The meeting closed at pm.
National Archives of Australia National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence Heroin Stocks After consultation with various medical authorities and interested professional groups the Commonwealth Government, on the recommendation of those authorities, prohibited the importation of heroin absolutely as from 1 January, As a result of this decision New South Wales and Western Australia purposes.
Other States decided to defer such action until existing stocks had been used up.
The matter is listed for discussion in view of the fact that some 18 years have elapsed since the ban on the importation of heroin and stocks are still being held in the country.
National Archives of Australia NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE ON DRUGS OF DEPENDENCE.
The functions of the National Standing Control Committee are to dissuade any form of drug abuse through the avenues of law enforcement, education and treatment.
Considerable progress has been made towards this goal.
At the last meeting of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence, the Chairman drew the attention of the committee to the lack of control over the sale of hypodermic syringes.
He sought advice in the light of continual evidence being collated about the misuse of this instrument by drug offenders.
If the situation was serious enough he felt that some form of recommendation could be made to the Commonwealth and State Health Ministers at their next meeting.
Owing to pressure of business there was an abstention of debate on this subject, but I undertook to make a submission about the subject matter at the next meeting.
I have not attempted to include defence measures against control over the sale of hypodermic syringes because I fairly accept argument that there are many legitimate uses for this implement in the fields of commerce, veterinary and Statistical information available from the Ne South Wales Drug Squad over the past three years indicates that 794 drug offerers used the hypodermic syringe as an implement of administration, compared with 1,546 oral takers of the syringe which warrants the need for some legal control over its use.
I have witnessed the deleterious results arising from the sadistic misuse of a hypodermic syringe readily available through the media of pharmacies, medical practitioners and auctions.
I respectfully suggest that the main consideration for central over this implement is to dissuade young people from graduating to hard drugs through its use.
From practical experience I have noticed that drugs of addiction are invariably administered by this means.
Questions about the uncontrolled sale of hypodermic syringes have often been directed by members of te public which resulted in me raising the issue bey fore the members of the New South Wales Poisons Advisory Committee.
However, this committee has adjourned any decision on the matter pending a review by the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence.
t is my belief that control over the sale of hypodermis syringes should be introduced and that at the time of sale a prescription or an order form should be presented by the purchaser, signed by an authorised person.
lr this suggestion does not meet with your approval I would like you to give further con sideration to a proposal that current Legislation be amended to make it an offence to unlawfully use a hypodermic syringe or similar instrument for the administration of a drug of addiction.
If adopted, similar provision to that relating to the possession of smoking utensils for the inhalation of Indian Hemp could be drafted.
In support of the submission set out herein I would like to draw the attention of this committee to the provisions of Section 5 of the South ''Any person who has in his possession any pipes, syringes or other utensils or any appliance or thing for use in connection with the preparation, smoking or administration of any drug to which this I cannot envisage that any great hardship would be created if control of this nature was introduced over the sale or use of hypodermic syringes.
If these submissions are rejected, then at least this committee can take comfort in the fact that the subject matter has been examined and a permanent reference to this fact included in the minutes.

National Archives of Australia Treatment and Rehabilitation At the meeting of the National Standing' Control Committee on 7 March 1969 it was recommended that a Working Party be established under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Department of Health to consider among other matters, the treatment of drug dependence.
The Mental Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council was approached for advice regarding treatment and rehabilitation of drug dependents.
The Committee recommended: ''Separate units specialising in the treatment of drug addicts and alcoholics be established in each State.
These facilities should be organised within the Staste Psychiatric Health At a meeting of the Health Working Party on 1 April 1969 the above recommendation was amended to: Facilities should be organised within the taste Psychiatric Health Services and should provide in-patientout-patient and intensive follow-up arrangements.

The Mental Health Committee provided the following advice: ''The most appropriate organisations for obtaining and evaluating information on treatment and rehabilitation services for drug dependency in each State would be the State Departments of The Committee noted that investigations had already commenced in Victoria as from 1 January 1970 and information was being maintained on a computer system by the Victorian Mental Health Authority.
New bout Wales has already examined the need for services for the compilation of statistical information.
Western Australia has no special personnel to evaluate the problem and investigations are being carried out on a The matter has been further referred to the Mental Health National Archives of Australia 1969 attention was drawn to the serious lack of reliable statistics on the The National Standing Control Committee on 7 March 1969 requested that the Mental Health Committee consider the collection of information on The Mental Health Committee considered that a programme was necessary to collect information about persons found to be dependent on drugs in Schedule 8 of the Uniform Poisons Schedules, hallucinogens, amphetamines and allied psychos that the enormus legal traffic in barbiturates might overload any system collecting information about the distribution of drugs of dependence.
The Committee considered that multiple cause coding of the causes of admission for psychiatric treatment would be necessary to identify all patients with drug dependence, because in some cases, drug dependence would be a secondary and not the primary diagnosis.
Normally, only the primary diagnosis is coded and tabulated.
It was recommended that this and other technical problems relating to mental health statistics should be studied by a small reference committee.
Terms The Hental Health Committee also pointed out that there was a need for enquiry on a broad sociological basis into the psychological, oconoric and cultural factors associated with drug dependence and also recognised that it would be very difficult to obtain the necessary data on a reliable basis.
The Committee agreed to keep this matter under reviex.
The National Standing Control Committee at its meeting of 1 April ''A programme is necessary to collect information about persons dependent on drugs in Schedule 8 of the Uniform Poisons Schedules, barbiturates end also drugs with smiler action in the list of Prohibited Substances as defined and/or listed in Uniform Poisons National Archives of Australia ''Medical authorities including private practitioners should assist law enforcement agencies as far as practicable in tracking don illicit sources of drugs., Patients should be encouraged to coy operate with the law onforcoment agencies on a voluntary basis, names of drug dependent patients available to Police and Customs authorities.

Such conclusions relate specifically to the complexity and cost of the manufacture of morphine from poppy straw which manufacture requires large quantities of raw material and large factory premises; all of these factors combine to render illicit manufacture of morphine prieticanly impossible.

It would appear that with the discovery of opium the use of infusions of poppy straw declined in favour of the more potent opium; this would account for the paucity of reports of cases of addiction to poppy heads.
Such reports do exist and the clinical effects of poppy straw addicition to Asian material are mell described by Chopra and others.
Significant differences in effects are that the excitement stage is more pronounced and the depressive stage is less than with opium.
In all other respects the effects resemble those of opium.
These differences are due to the higher narcotine content of the Asian with a mean value of 1.0% morphine, with only a small amount of other alkaloids.
This means that the straw is approximately equivalent in morphine content to 8. The high actual morphine content, and the high morphine content relative to other alkaloids is probably due to breeding, so the seed distribution must be 9.
The morphine is concentrated in the capsule wall and the amount debases down the stem.
Seeds and dried leaves of the plant contain no detectable alkaloids.
Methods of Abuse on (known as Post in India).
The straw may be soaked in water and the liquid drunk. .
bomoking The straw may be smoked in a pipe.
Short stemmed pipes give a ''Burnt'' tongue so it is normal to use a water cooled or long stemmed pipe.
Work National Archives of Australia done in Melbourne indicates that 85% of the morphine will be inhaled with the lR This comes from the green plant and is not considered important in 5. Extraction of alkaloids or conversion to heroin, Work done in the Melbourne Customs Laboratory has shorn that heroin can be produced under ''crude white depending on the care taken, and would be readily saleable.
Tasmanian poppy straw has a definite abuse potential.
2. With the increased tendency for youth to experiment with drugs of all sorts it is surprising that the abuse potential of poppy straw has not yet been discovered.
3. The presence of poppy cultivations adjacent to public roads in Tasmania as described by Mr. Potts would seem to be inviting early public discovery of the undoubted abuse potential of poppy straw.
It would appear desirable to curtail present guided tours of the poppy fields and to remove from circulation all posters and other material advertising the presence of the fields. .
It is considered that there should be strict but discrete control measures over both crop and production.

A DRUG EDUCATION SUB COMMITTEE It may b assumed at the present time that the great majority of young pecple in schools and universities are untouched by the taint However, young people in adolescence and in the period of transition from adolescence to adulthood are interested in experiment, and drugs may be resented to them as an interesting experience.
Moreover young people enjoy activities with an element of risk, Many educators are aware that making too much of a particular problem in isolation or with undue emphasis on certain aspects of the problem may actually encourage rather than diminish erperiment.
Mt if an educational institution accepts the personal growth of the student as its responsibility, then education about drug abuse can be viewed as part of the general programme for providing sstudents with information, which will assist them to develop helpful attitudes relevant to the problems encountered in achieving maturity.
This process, having begun within the family, continues in the primary school, and is accelerated in the secondary school.
education programme has been in operation in a school there is less drug abuse than in comparable schools without such a programme.
We are faced with a complex of factors which one educator rather depressingly summed up as being composed of hedonism, affluence, loneliness, gregariousness, lack of ambition or an excess of it, faction or unfamiliarity with the cultural and sporting interests that could absorb young people's energies, contempt for the experience of elders, unsatisfactory family relationships, and loss or lack of religious faith or attachment.
National Archives of Australia A Many educators therefore believe that they must tackle the problem of drug abuse within the context of other social evils, recognising that the problems of excessive drinking of alcohol and cigarette smoking may be more immediately serious, since the social attitude which promotes heavy drinking seems to be an integral part of the male role, which in turn may encourage a psychological environment in which progression to drug-taking may become a fashionable duty, especially since it ray appear less harmful initially.

problem of physical, mental and oral health, and they must be careful to ensure that the structure of their whole programme keeps all these problems in reasonable relationship with one another.
They will wish in their teaching to treat the problem of drugs dependence as part of a total picture of personality-analysis, and to include education about drugs within a comprehensive programme of health education as a component of education for living.
For young people must be enabled to appreciate the differences between the intelligent use of drugs and drug-abuse, in living a healthful life.
Since we have not a single national system and since the education of the personality is not confined to a single phase of the process of education, it must be emphasised that the following recommendations are confined to the provision of practical aids and to the suggestion of certain principles.
A. Each educational authority or institution will of course choose its ow method of dealing with the problem.
This may be done through formally prescribed Health and Physical Education Courses, such as already exist under some State authorities, or by diluted instruction through related subject areas such as the Social Sciences, Religious Education, General Studies, General Science or specialist courses such Where the system of diluted instruction is adopted it is usually thought desirable for a senior teacher to be responsible for coy ordination of the health topics.
The appointment of an adviser in health, including drug use, to visit schools and to arrange appropriate in-service training or provide resource materials has much to commend it, for teachers who are to deal competently with a health and social problem such as drug use and abuse must themselves be well informed.
The services of Health Departments are often available, but teachers may be unaware of the State resources available.

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that attempts at persuasion based on high fear appeal or on exaggerated claims are generally ineffective, and may produce the opposite effects, especially where the audience is intelligent, critical and possessed of a considerable degree of information on the topic.
(2) Education should emphasise that the human being cannot be happy unless he is a member of society, which involves a certain surrender on the part of the individual to the needs of others.
Duty to self, in health as well as in morals, is therefore inseparable from duty to the community.

On the law enforce- meant side the Working Party onDrug Intelligence had met and was moving rapidly towards completing arrangemeants for channelling drug information into the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau.
On the health side a lot had been done including excellent progress towards implementing the scheme to computerise the recording and checking of drug transactions.
AGENDA ITEM 2 FORMAL CONFIRMATION OF RECORD OF SECOND MEETING ON SNOW seconded that the minutes of the previous meeting be adopted.
AGENDA ITEM - LAW ENFORCEMENT Report of Working Party on Drug Intelligence THE CHAIRMAN explained that the Working Party had been set up under the chairmanship of Commissioner Davis who had furnished a report to the Standing Committee.
In the absence of Commissioner Davis he invited the MR.
HARPER summarised the recommendations of the Working Party.
He damn up a form for use in reporting drug intelligence to the Central Crime who had agreed to use it.
The form was with the printer and when completed would be distributed.
The form was on distinctive yellow paper.
No department was shown on the top and it could be used by all parties.
In reply to a question by suede CubER, Mr, Harper explained that reminder cards mould be used to remind furnishing parties to send follow-up MR RIMES said Ne South Wales accepted the views of the Working Party.
In regard to resolution 6 the matter was before the New South ales Police Commissioner who would discuss it with Commissioner Davis.
With regard to the composite form, le agreed it was acceptable and it would ultimately appear as an official form of the New South Wales Police.
National Archives of Australia INSPECTOR SIMPSON sought clarification of the position regarding resolution 0 dealing with overdoses of Barbiturates.
WIENHOLT felt that the recommendation would need clarification before it could be considered by the Standing Committee.
''Overdose'' included matters which could not be dealt with by the C.L.I.B. MR.
NEVIN pointed out the value of authorities having information on apparent attempted suicides.
OODRUP considered that the matter was one for the Health Working Party to consider Each event had wide possibilities of medical overtones.
They may be straight out accidents, but if intentional, then it should be reported to the authorities.
If it was a case of misadventure, it had nothing to do with law enforcement except if negligence was present.
THE CHAIRMAN supported this view but invited the attention of the Committee to the wording of the resolution - ''Is there a need for reporting?''
SNOW agreed with the need for reporting but ''overdose'' must DR Attempted suicide Suicide Accidental overdose in children Knowledge of this could give authorities an idea of the extent of misuse.
He suggested that the matter should go to the Health Working Party on the DET.
ABBOTT said that his Departmeant opposed the reporting of such cases on the new form as most cases investigated had no law enforce- meant aspect.
In addition it would involve Police in a very large amount MR POGAN considered that further discussion of this matter at this stage should be left to the Health Working Party, which could decide whether it was the type of problem appropriate for the C.C.I.B. to record.
MACINTIRE agreed it was a matter for referral to the Health Working Party.
The Mental Health services were equally involved.
me reporting by Police to C.C.I.B. not Health.
The matter was therefore one for the Working Party on Drug Intelligence, to decide what Folice will do in reporting cases coming to their notice.
The other matter of what should be the obligations of the Medical Profession and Health Services to report cases should be taken up by the Health Working Party. .
DE questioned the value to Police of reports on such cases by Health Authorities unless a full report was received.
National Archives of Australia -L pointed out that a National system of reporting such MR NEVIN considered it was a Police matter to see the pattern of where these cases came from.
It could be valuable for Folice to have THE CHAIRMAN asked the meeting to decide :- (a) should the matter be referred to the Health (b) if it is to be essentially a Police matter could it go back to the Working Party on Drug Intelligence?
WIENHOLT felt that the Health Working Party would be able to come up with recommendations on what action should be taken, and moved to The committee agreed to accept the report of the working Party.
THE CHAIRMAN formally accepted the report and congratulated the Working Party on the progress made.
THE CHAIRMAN said that the question of review of legislation is still under review insofar as the Commonwealth was concerned.
He invited State representatives to report ondevelopments in their States.
MACINTYRE asked for clarification on the outcome of discussions on reverse onus and uniform penalty.
He felt it was important to get some recommendation.
The matter should be finalised in order to enable uniformity to be achieved.
THE CHAIMAN referred to the lengthy discussions that the meeting of Ministers had on reverse onus.
Before the Commonwealth moved there would be discussions with the States.
He pointed out that there had been specific recommendations to Ministers from the Working Party on Legislation.
NWOODRUFE reported that a submission had gone to the Government of S.A. to amend legislation to incorporate the recommendations.
It was anticipated the bill would be dealt with in the current session of Parliament.
MR STRUTTON said that Queensland was looking into possible amend- mens of the health Act.
Consideration was also being given to a separate act for drugs of dependence and drug penalties.
SNOW advised that the matter was still under consideration in National Archives of Australia MR. RIMES said that in New South Wiales any amendments would be in respect of penalties for pedlars and similar offences.
NEVIN said that Victorian law at present adequately covered MR.
STRUTTON pointed out the possibility that States could bring in increased penalties but come up with differing scales.
THE CHAIRMAN appreciated that this could happen but he envisaged that all States would ultimately progress towards a desirable level of penalties.
He believed that the Ministers had accepted in principle the need for increased and uniform penalties.
THE CHAIRMAN explained that the item had its origin in directives from Ministers that the committee develop co-operation and liaison to a maximum degree.
This included development of the C.C .I.B.
He took the opportunity to report developments in the Customs Narcotics Bureaue Shortly after the Ministers meeting he was based to go overseas nation was most anxious to co-operate with the Customs Bureau.
In addition an operative of the U.S. Bureau stationed in Thailand would be coming to Australia in the near future for discussions with Customs and Police.
The coming to Australia in February, 1970.
Customs had taken up an invitation to send two persons to the Federal Narcotics Bureau School.
The two officers had successfully completed the course and were nw engaged in field operations with the U.S, Narcotics Bureau.
The officer recently recruited from the subject tothe approval of Commissioners, arrangements would be made for selected Police Officers to attend future courses.
A senior Chemist from the Customs Laboratory had also visited scient tific establishments in usa and Canada and this matter would be dealt with He considered that the exchange of officers between Customs and the Victoria Police was highly successful but he now felt that such a formal arrangement was no longer necessary, particularly in view of the successful working together of Customs/Police teams in joint operations in most States.
Problems of conflicting interest had been virtually eliminated.
Customs Narcotics Bureau Officers had been directed to pass on to Police any cases involving users and petty pedlars.
He felt that a lot of progress had been made in the area of co-operation.
He then said that he had received approval tostrengthen the Narcotics Bureau and gave an outline of the proposals.
National Archives of Australia MR NEVIN agreed that the exchange of officers in Victoria had worked very well and to the advantage of both parties.
He appreciated the opportunity given for State Police officers to go overseas to attend courses in drug investigation.
MR RIMES said that New South ales was very happy with the degree of co-operation between Police and Customs.
He would be pleased to receive information on the proposed courses.
INSPECTOR SIMPSON reported that there had been two Police/Customs field operations in Queensland.
They were a prime example of good coy operation.
He felt that his Commissioner would welcome the offer of very good and his Department was happy with the assistance given.
He supported the idea of overseas courses.
INSPECTOR BURRONS stated that his Department enjoyed the utmost co-operation from Customs and was very happy with the present position.
DR. MACINTYRE advised that the Commissioner of Police would be interested in the Chairman's offer of courses for police officers in U.S.A. and said that he had held discussions with the Folice Commissions who was very happy with the degree of co-operation which existed in Tasmania.
SNOW suggested that it would be useful to prepare a brief statement proposed overseas study courses to justify to Ministers the need for these trips.
THE CHAIRMAN agreed.
AGENDA ITEM 3,4 Reports of illicit transactions and seizures to U.N. and Interpol THE CHAIRMAN explained that the item related to the fact that under the SINGLE CONVENTION Australia had the responsibility to forward information to the Narcotics Commission.
Customs was responsible for this reporting and had been receiving the required information direct from the States - particularly from New South Wales.
A situation had now arisen where, because of decisions arising from the Working Party on Drug Intelligence, there was a possibility of unnecessary duplication of work arising.
This should be eliminated.
The matter concerned the furnishing of reports on illicit drug transactions.
He believed the simplest way to avoid duplication would be that, when these forms are sent to the C.t.1., a photo copy would be sent to Customs for processing and subsequent report to the U.N.
He emphasised that copies would be procured of only those forms which contained information which Australia was required to furnish to the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs.
WOODRUFE wondered if such an arrangement might influence what police would put into the report.
Natibonal Archives of Australia HARPER said that C.C.I.B. would not pass on any information which the States did not want passed bona INSPECTOR SIMPSON said that Queensland envisaged the form of report being furnished to C,u.1.., which would extract information from the form for supply to Customs.
ironer that, since Customs is a full contributor to the C...B. it is entitled to get all the information it required on drug intelligence from in the matter and would abide by the Committee's decision.
However, they would not like to see a precedent created whereby intelligence information MR RIMES felt that there should not be anything to inhibit the exchange of information between contributing parties.
If it was confidential to a particular Police force, it could be marked so.
HARPER said that if the reports or parts thereof were marked ''restricted'' the restricted information would not be passed on to another body without the approval of the originating authority.
CALDER suggested that only those authorities who contributed information should be entitled to obtain intelligence material from the C.C.I.B.
From the operational aspect Police could have suspicions about persons and these could be included on the form if Police were sure that the form had limited circulation.
The Committee agreed to the following :- ''On the understanding that the Department of and Excise will provide Ill ad comprehensive dr the have no obvention to that THE CHAIRMAN said that theestablishment of the laboratory had its origin in a visit to the US.

The Bureau had also asked Australia to co-operate with it in research programmes.
A particular project was analysis of the constituents of National Archives of Australia marihuana.
The Narcotics laboratory would be equipped to carry out forensic research into drugs of dependence with the prime object of assisting all law enforcement bodies.
All members of the Committee expressed support for the stab- AGENDA ITEM 4 REPORT OF HEALTH WORKING PARTY DR.
WIENHOIT summarised the recommendations of the Health Working Party and invited State representatives to express their views on the question tames asked if States were obligated to accept full inspects THE CHAIRMAN assured MR Ptames that Customs would liaise with each state with the obtect of ensuring a smooth transition period which would vary according to the circumstances in each State.
PATRICK advised that Queensland also had some initial problems and would like to discuss details with Customs at the officer levels DR.
WOODRUFF expressed agreement with the proposals and advised that he had obtained approval for an additional Inspector.
MACINTIRE said he was pleased with the progress made in closing possible loopholes.
However, as next step it may be wise to .
SNOW advised that WA, was prepared to accept inspectorial functions but would probably need assistance during the first three months of 970.
He asked that the following corrections be made to the report in stimulants'' -. this was incorrect as the State already licensed such people.
W.A, did not agree that transactions in barbiturates and tranqualizers may need to be monitored in the future.
THE CHAIRMAN advised that the report would be amended accordingly.
DR WIENHOIT sa virtue in Customs and state Health continuing to work together until late in 197.
National Archives of Australia THE CHAIRMAN commended the Health Working Party and the Commonwealth Dept, of Health as well as the Sub-Wiorking Party on Monitoring for the work that they had carried out.
WIENHOLT invited State representatives to report on action taken by them in the Health Education field.
He reported that on the in Health Education in Relation to Drug Abuse.
Dr Wells was undertaking to see that people attend ding the course were offered every facility; film on drug dependence were well advanced.
The Working Party handling planning for the firm had been sifted its activities and the National Fitness Council had also been Education Department had been approached to assist in Health Education in High Schools.
Appropriate officers would be sent to the Sydney Seminar.
M roan reported that the Health Department would be sending four officers to the seminar on health education DR.
WIENHOLT asked States which had not furnished a written report on action taken to do so as soon as possible.
PATRICK said that the Health Education Council in Queensland which had been operating in the field for many years had recently stepped up its activities in this area.
DR WOODRUFF said that Police officers dealing with drug matters were often asked questions with llealth connotations.
ll asked if suitable DR WINHOIT said he would look at tlematter and see what was being done overseas.
If anything worthwhile could be done he would look at it from the point of view of a residential seminar.
admission to the Health Education Seminar, PR.
MIENHOLI in reply to queries regarding attendance by Police Officers and persons from voluntary agencies, proposed that the matter be left on the basis that States choose their own representatives.
National Archives of Australia THE CHAIRMAN referred to the commercial film ''TEasy Riders'', and tad that it had been shown by the Chief Film Censor to Dr. Elements, ming whether it undermined efforts in education against drug abuse.
Cn the advice of these persons the Film Censorship Board decided to reject the film,
The Chairman referred to Educational handout material which he had received from the U.S Bureau of Narcotics and offered to obtain copies for distribution to States through the Commonwealth Health Department.
THE CHAIRMAN asked DR.
MIENHOUT to talk to the item and suggested under article 18 of the Single Convention, to furnish statistics of drug dependence to U.N.
It was clear that such statistics had to be improved.
He advised that the N.H. d M.R.C. had agreed to a definition of drug dependence which was set out in the ''Gloasary of Mental Disorders'' published by the Council.
joan accepted this definition provided that it was for statistical purposes only, as it could not be applied generally in Wiotoria, as the Victorian Act had a different definition of drug dependent PRe meld pointed out that, whilst States had different definitions, all had agreed to international classifications of mental disorders and this THE CHAIRMAN considered that there was need for commonality of definition for the purpose of reporting atatistios of dependence to U.N. DR.
WIENHOUE pointed out that if there was a different set of figures for mental health statistics on dependence and data sent to Customs the disorepanoies could well be picked up.
Also any information that Australia supplied to U.N. must be complementary to information supplied by other countries.
The statistical eriterim were a matter for consultation oman pointed out that in victoria it was necessary to adhere to the definition of addition laid down by law.
There was a different abasia for mentalhealth statistics of dependence and statistics sent to Customs for the Annual Report.
MRe RIME greed that the Committee adopt the definition of dependence laid down in the glossary of Mental Disorders'' prepared by the recorded because it would drastically change statistics received from the DEM sots
ABBOTT suggested that data concerning users of drugs not established as addicts be furnishedunder the heading of drug abuse.
National Archives of Australia DOCTORS now R PATRICK agreed that whilst it was acceptable to use the term 'dependence'', it was necessary to be clear as to the meaning of the of the definition of dependence contained in the DR.
MIENHOLI said that the Health Working Party acknowledged this to be a State responsibility.
It was incorrect therefore for the Common- wealth to indicate what it believed States should do in their own areas.
MR RIMES considered that the question nevertheless should not be pushed aside.
lt was an important item for the Committee and it should mr be left open for future discussion.
roan felt that this subject was not an appropriate one for discussion by the Committee.
The proposal, if adopted, instructed how States were to deal with the treatment of drug dependent persons and this was, he said, a matter for the States.
He thought that the first concept of the proposal was not appropriate for the Committee, as the matter was exclusively THE CHAIRMAN said that the Commonwealth was not prepared, without further consideration by the Commonwealth Minister's concerned, to undertake financial responsibility for treatment.
However this should not inhibit discussion by the Standing Committee.
MR RIMES pointed out that the Committee had been discussing common areas of concern and he felt that treatment was also a common area and should endations on treatment at its March meeting and it was now a matter for the States to consider them.
Party to examine the problem of treatment and rehabilitation.
roan said that he had no charter nor could he pledge any support for it.
THE CHAIRMAN verified that the subject was within the Committee's terms of reference as laid down by Ministers.
MOODRUFE agreed to the matter being referred to the Health the nd rehab question of treatment a be referred to the health Working Partv for its vlewss Nnational Archives of Australia THE CHAIRMAN explained the present position with regard to prepar- nation of the draft Protocol and announced that he intended to recommend that representnation at the Plenipotentiary Conference be drawn from the Standing Committee.
He explained that the January meeting of the Narcotics Commission would merely put together a further draft Protocol on the basis of comments received from governments.
Australia would have ample time to examine this next draft which would be examined in detail and amended as required at the Plenipotentiary conference.
predominantly health flavour the delegation should be comprised mainly of AGENDA ITEM 6 MEETING OF MINISTERS THE CI left it to the standing Committee to recommend when the next meeting of Ministers should be held, He felt in the light of the current work of the Standing Committee, it was not appropriate for Ministers to meet at present.
He also invited the Committee to consider when the Standing Committee might The Committee agreed that it should meet regain earl in the for a Ministerial meetng before the next meet National Standing Control Committee to be held in April.
RIMES said that NS.W. did not want to set up any formal line of communication or provide a central reporting service in a matter of this THE CHAIRMAN agreed and added that the Commonwealth could not provide such a service.
RoAN pointed out that even an informal arrangement of reporting without indemnity could lead to trouble.
be considered that the problem could be covered by the fact that people engaged in drug operations had to be approved under State law.
NEVIN pointed out that the initiative was coming from the trade to approach the authorities in regard to theproblem of security risks. .
SNOW asked whether there was in fact any information regarding persons such as addicts or persons dismissed for theft.
ELLS explained that the lanaging-irector of a firm had Subsequently it was found that five of the former employees had been engaged by other drug firms.
The Managing-Director had then raised the National Archives of Australia there were many instances where persons were dismissed without charges being laid and police had no record of their activities.
However, he had found that employers normally checked with previous employers concerning the suitability of applicants.
MR roan said that informal arrangements were made within the DR SNOW considered that when the new monitoring procedures were operating, lt might be easier for employers to get evidence to prosecute Re MIENHOII pointed out that the Government was seeking the co-operation of Industry in establishing the system for the monitoring of licit transactions in drugs of dependence.
Now industry had approached Health authorities for assistance and we should not say that nothing could be done.
He suggested that the Committee announce that the States are developing informal arrangements and that industry will be able to approach the appropriate authority for assistance The Committee agreed that industry be informed thor formal basis for such advice could be set un but that extension of informal avenues of liaison would be THE CHAIRMAN explained that the importation of Amphetamines was controlled for the purpose of restricting them to legitimate channels.
imported had been very large and inquiries concerning requirements for 1970 showed that even greater quantities were being sought.
It was considered that some importers might be stocking up because of possible restrictions being applied later.
M POGAN suggested that the matter be considered by the Public Committee should look at the question of amphetamines and the way they are THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that the problem of stocking up was already with us and it was necessary to make a decision on the level of 197O importations as soon as possible.
He asked whether it would be possible for DR WOODPUFF felt that there would be general support for not THE CHAIRMAN suggested that Customs ascertain what stocks importers have and what their usage had been and then confine 1970 imports to recouping quantities used.
National Archives of Australia MR. imps pointed out that there were very few medical cases control and limitation of use to narcolepsy and brain-damaged children.
The Committee agreed that the question of medical use tt a resort and that in the meantime the Department o toms and Excise should impose import quotas for SUPT.
CALDER asked the Committee for clarification on which authorities would be entitled to extract information from the C.C.I.B.
He pointed out that the armed services and A.S.I.0.
were examples of other authorities which might seek information.
However, once extended, there was no knowing where it would lead to.
The Committee should ensure that people seeking information should do so through the contributing authorities from the States concerned.
M rims suggested that requests be looked at on the basis of need and dealt with at the discretion of C.v..1.. that there be a limit placed on the types of authorities entitled to information.
However he agreed that requests by noncontributing parties should go through the police in the State concerned., wanted it known that he would supply information only to other Police authorities and to Customs without his Department first being consulted.
THE CHAIRMAN considered that the matter was one for negotiation between C.w.1.. and State Police at Commissioner level.
the led to obtain informati is was a matter for THE CHAIRMAN in closing the meeting thanked delegates for their active participation and expressed great satisfaction with the way the Committee had developed.
What had greatly impressed him was that when it first met members of the Committee had some reservations but it was now National Archives of Australia clear that they were able to get together and were making progress.
The problem of drug dependence was getting worse and would get a lot worse before it improved.
His trip overseas had snowed him that the situation in U.S.A. was shocking and not much better in U.K. and Europe.
The problem was not as bad in Australia and every effort had to be made to stop it re imps in reply agreed that the Committee now worked as a team.
He said that provided members could subjugate feelings for their own organisations the Committee could continue to work together effectively.

National Archives of Australia NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE ON DRUGS OF DEPENDENCE Minister for the Interior, I am attaching hereto the report of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence, as requested by Ministers for their meeting on the Bth May.
The Committee has met formally on two occasions and to assist its deliberations, it set up working parties to consider Ministers will appreciate that, because of the relatively short time since their earlier meeting, it has not been possible for the Standing Committee to go in depth into all aspects of the matters set out in its terms of reference.
However, positive suggestions have been made to increase n the Health area, Ministers will note that a preliminary examination has been made of the wide range of future activities.
Indeed, the recommendations of the Standing Committee in this area I particularly invite the attention of Ministers to the recommendations of the Standing Committee as to its future activities for National Archives of Australia A xs A NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE a ON DRUGS OF DEPENDENCE REPORT TO MINISTERS NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE ON REPORT TO MINISTERS This report has been prepared as directed by Ministers at the Commonwealths State Ministers' Meeting on Drugs of Dependence held A The National Standing Control Committee consists of representatives of the Commonwealth Ddepartments of Customs and Excise, Attorneys General's, Health and Interior and the departments in each State concerned with the problems of drug abuse.
The Comptroller-General of Customs is the Chairman.
The Committee was directed to: (a) consider immediately the further steps that can be taken by the Commonwealth and rotates together to combat all aspects of the present drug problem in Australia including administrative action which should be taken.
Meetings of the Committee were held on 7 March and 1l April 1969.
The summary records of these meetings are attached.
The Committee felt that its designated task could best be fulfilled by a consideration of the overall problem under two broad LAW ENFORCEMENT Current legislation in the field of controlling the illicit traffic in drugs is enforced at Commonwealth level by the department of Customs and Excise and at State level by Police Drug Squads.
Because investigations often overlap and because drug abuse is a national problem, the Committee felt that positive steps must be taken to improve the present arrangements for co-ordination and co-operation between all law enforcement authorities.
General of Customs proposed an exchange of officers in each State, between the Customs Narcotics Bureau and Police Drug Squads.
The Commonwealth felt that if this proposal were implemented, the problem of overlapping investigations would disappear and further, that it would provide another means of exchanging intelligence information at State reactions to the proposal are set out in Agenda Item 2.l on page 2 of the summary record of the meeting of 11 April 1969.
It will be seen that with the exception of New South Walesg and queensland, all State representatives agreed with the proposal in principle but that because the problem in W.A., S.A and tasmania is not as great as in the other three States, itsis not necessary to implement such arrangements in these States at the present time.
2. Exchange of Information The Committee considered that there is a need for a central source to collect and disseminate intelligence information on illicit activities within Australia.
Such a source must have the capacity to collate.
evaluate and disseminate data from all enforcement agencies (and possibly etc, to enable a co-ordinated attack on the illicit drug traffic.
The Committee noted that the following organisations were in existence at the present time: a (i) A Central Crime Intelligence Bureau within the Commonwealth Police which required information on narcotics offences as part of its overall task of a assessing organised crime in Australia; (ii) A narcotic intelligence unit situated within the A Customs Narcotics Bureau which at present a collected and disseminated narcotics intelligence from within Australia and overseas for its own operational purposes; and (xiii) A Central Drug Bureau operated by the New South in other States.
The Committee noted that certain recent proposals by the Conference of Police Commissioners had attempted to define the relative roles of the Commonwealth Central Crime Intelligence Bureau and the N.S.W. Central Drug Bureau.
The Committee resolved: 'That the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau established and maintained by Commonwealth Police should be extended to include information in regard to drug intelligence and that a Working Party comprised of Commonwealth and State officials affected, be established to examine how it should 3. Communication with International Bodies As The Committee noted that the Department of Customs and Excise maintained comprehensive links with overseas drug agencies and that the ietorian Police Commissioner is the Interpol contact in Australia.
The question of State representation at overseas conferences was discussed and the Committee felt that if effective co-operation and co-ordination were achieved, State representatives should attend such The Committee appointed a Working Party under the Chairmanship deficiencies in enforcement and penalty provisions in existing legislation relating to drug control.
The Working Party examined recent case law in England redefining the concept of possession'' and considered deficiencies in Customs and State legislation.
I broad terms, the Committee agreed that reverse onus of proof should be applied to drug offences.
The specific recommendations of this Working Party are set out in The Committee has adopted these recommendations.
However, the report was not received by the Standing Committee until after the com mencement of their meeting on ll April and, for this reason, could not because of the demonstrated need to improve the legal evidentiary prod visions of the Customs Acet to overcome difficulties in proving Common- wealth offences, decided to make the following additional recommendation to Ministers.
This recommendation has not yet been considered by the ) that the Customs Act should be amended to incorporate the reverse onus as to the fact of importation of prescribed drugs which are HEALTH ASPECTS A Working Party under the Chairmanship of the Commonwealth department of Health was appointed to consider: (a) licit transactions involving Single Convention drugs and other drugs of dependence; A The convenor of the Working Party called together the relevant committees of the NH and MRC in anticipation of the first meeting of the Working Party.
A report of the Working Party was prepared and is annexed as The Committee's views on the Working Party Report are set I The Committee adopted the recommendations of the Working Party except that in relation to item 2.11 of the Report.
The representatives of the Department of Customs and Excise and the I recommendation might be an accurate assessment of the principles involved, in view of the immediate need to combat unfavourable publicity, the recommendation is not sufficiently constructive.
They felt that Ministers should consider the issue of an authoritative white paper on the problems associated with narcotics and drugs of dependence or at least to decide some positive steps that should be taken.
Some State Representatives also supported the issue of a white paper.
8. Mental Health Aspects The Committee adopted the recommendations of the Working 3.4.
Treatment and Social Rehabilitation of Addicts The Committee deleted all words after discouraged'' in the second The Committee felt that there was scope for closer co-operation between Commonwealth and States in controlling the legal distribution of narcotics and other drugs of dependence.
The Comptroller-General of Customs informed the Committee that it was the view of the Commonwealth that such matters were primarily the concern of Health departments and that areas of overlapping control by Commonwealth and States could be virtually eliminated.
The Department of Customs and Excise considered that it was preferable to have a single authority coy ordinating the licit distribution of narcotics and therefore offered to hand over this role to the Commonwealth Department of Health.
The Depart- meant of Customs and Excise would have to retain its responsibility for Imports/ Export controls and its statutory responsibility under the Narcotic Drugs Act.
Further, the Commonwealth offered to vacate the inspection activities involved in controlling drug distribution in favour of State Health Departments provided it received regular stock figures in respect of wholesalers.
md The Committee noted that State Ministers had stressed the need for a central clearing house to collect and disseminate information relating to interstate movements of prescribed drugs.
The Committee resolved that paragraph l of the Working Party'g recommendation be amended as follows: (i) That a system be set up to collect, collate and A disseminate information on all interstate move- mens of drugs of dependence and that a Working Party be established to introduce such a system The Working Party should, at the same time examine the feasibility, value and practicability of establishing a system to provide information on all aspects of the intrastate trade.
After a close examination of its future activities, the Committee recommends that there is no need for permanent subcommittees and that its operations can best be facilitated by ad hoc Working Parties This report has indicated the areas in which the Committee propose to continue its activities and recommends to Ministers that the Standing Control Committee should meet at least every 6 months and more often if circumstances require.
NATIONAL STANDIG CONTROL COMMITTEE SUMMARY RECORD A AGENDA ITEM 1. SUMMARY RECORD OF FIRST MEETING The summary record of the meeting held on 7th March 1969 The Committee agreed to amend the wording of its resolution in regard to the terms of reference of the Health Working Party.
Because it was clearly intended that the Working Party examine the whole field of AGENDA ITEM 2. LAW ENFORCEMENT The Chairman referred to the recommendation of the previous meeting that each State examine the Customs proposal for the exchange of Customs Narecotic Officers and State Police Drug quad officers and report back to the present meeting.
He called upon the State representatives to record their reaction to the proposal.
Victoria supported the proposal but all other States indicated, that, in line with the recommendation of the recent Police Commissioner's Conference, the proposal was not supported.
The Chairman said that he was amazed at the negative reaction to the proposal, particularly when the Ministers had directed the Committee to specific recommendations in that regard.
Ministers wanted the Committee to demonstrate publicly that it was determined to come up with constructive In the circumstances, it seemed that he would be forced to report to Ministers that the Committee did not agree that any improvement He agreed that South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania may not need a formal exchange at present but that did not apply in the States with the greatest problem.
a Mr, Dillon proposed that the reactions of each State to the proposal be recoroe mn the summary record.
He urged that the Committee affirm that it realized the need for greater coyoperation and coyordination and moved the following resolution: ''That this meeting confirm that positive steps must be taken to improve the present arrangements for coy ordination and coyoperation between all law enforcement a Pr.
nOw seconded the motion which was carried unanimously.
After discussion, State Representatives recorded their reactions as follows: between Customs and State Police authorities.
However he undertook to bring the views of other States and the Commonwealth to the notice of his Government with a view to his Minister being in a position to state definitely the views of the New South Wales Government on the Commonwealth Victoria agreed with the exchange proposal.
Victoria was prepared to accept the Commonwealth's offer on a trial basis, the extent and duration of attachment to be determined by negotiation.
o a Iaw enforcement matter and as such, the final decision would be made by the Minister in charge of the Police Department in Queensland A who is the Premier.
It had not been possible for his Minister to discuss the matter with the Premier and the opinions which would be given at this meeting would be decisions of officers which could rightly be vetoed by their respective Ministers.

consldered that it would be impracticable at present to exchange officers The Chairman drew attention to the proposal on the establishment of previous meeting and deferred to the current meeting so as to enable it to be considered by State authorities.
He asked State representatives to give their views on the proposal.
Mr. Rimes stated that the Conference of Police Commissioners had operational information on drugs for all Police forces.
The Commonwealth Central Crime intelligence Bureau would not be operational but would be concerned with statistical recording.
He confirmed this Mr Dillon understood that the consensus of opinion of Commissioners was that each Police Force should have its own information service.
He envisaged a National Drug Intelligence Bureau within the Commonwealth Central Crime Intelligence Bureau into which would be fd all information, including information from the New South Wales operational bureau, and to which States could go direct for information.
The Chairman pointed out that the Commonwealth had also considered the matter and had taken note of the existence of the Intelligence Section within the Customs Narcotics Bureau and the need for drug information to be collected and analysed by the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau as part of its examination of organised crime in Australia.
It would be necessary to ascertain what intelligence information customs Crime Intelligence urea.

He added that the Department of Customs nd Exeise as the Australian control body for purposes of the single Convention receives from State Police for transmission to the United Nations reports of all seizures of Narcotics in Australia.
Details of these reports, together with all Customs Intelligence reports are collated and can be made available to operational law enforcement bodies at present.
In addition to this he said that apparently Police Commissioners shed to have set up a record of all drug prosecutions within the Commonwealth Police and a Central Operational Record System with Mr RImes suggested that a Working Party be set up to work ou entails concerning the furnishing of information to the authoritles mr lion moved the following recommendation in substitution ir MThat the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau established and maintained by Commonwealth Police should be eytended to include information in regard to drug established to examine how it should operate.
Tke Chairman in introducing the report, said that the purpose of the forging Party's deliberations was to be able to report to Ministers 0n efficiencies in legislation.
He was surprised that so few had been referred to in this report.
The Chairman asked if there was any objection to the Committee acormmending to Ministers that the reverse onus device is approprlae to drug offences and should be incorporated in legislatlon Mr Rimes proposed the following resolution: nTho Committee resolved that the report of the irking Party be endorsed but that it be redrafted embers of the National Standing Committee IOr The report of the Woirking arty is Attachment ''A a In discussing penalties some representatives expressed the view that because of operational difficulties, it was preferable for most offences to be dealt with summarily.
Dr. Wienholt on the invitation of the Chairman, introduced the report generally he explained that, because of all the varying forces involved and the concern of Education Departments about extra-curricular activities, implementation of the recommendations would take time and not a great deal could be achieved before the Meeting of Ministers on The Committee agreed to the following recommendations proposed by the Working Party: The elements of an education programme about the usage and occasional abuse of drugs should be set into the general obiectives of a health education programme commencing before the child enters the phase of experimentation.
This would include - (i) Teaching in schools and provision of aids to instruction including films and physiological, psychological and social aspects of drug abuse and in discriminating consumer usage of drugs as part of the and provision of teacher handbooks.
Doctors and Dentists 'The attention of the appropriate education authorities should be drawn to the need for the teaching of social aspects associated with the use and abuse of drugs and particularly drugs of dependence or addiction, both ''The attention of the Pharmaceutical Association of Australia and State Pharmaceutical Societies be drawn to The responsible role which pharmacists play in the community in relation to the distribution of drugs of dependence, education of the public and adequate security with respect to these drugs.''
3. 1. 4 Women of middle age who are at risk in relation to drugs 'The attention of the National Council of Women and other appropriate organisations should be drawn to the problems which are common among women.
These can often lead to undue usage of drugs of dependence There is a need for positive action to be taken by the National Council of Women and other appropriate organisations a to assist as many as possible of these women at risk '' 3. 1.5 Training of key health education personnel ''Consideration should be given to the organisation of a A residential training course of approximately two weeks duration for training key health education personnel from each of the States in the most effective educational The Chairman asked the Committee to look carefully at the matter of publicity campaigns because there were two schools of thought on Dr Wienholt said that the Working Party had borne this in mind ut ret that whenever there had been campaigns designed to counter publicity the resultant publicity had the opposite effect.
The Chairman considered that the recommendation was negative although not objectionable as far as principles are concerned.
The fears of the Working Party that publicity may cause drug taking to become fashionable had been realized years ago.
What was needed was judicious publicity to try to counteract antisocial publicity.
It was not good enough to run away from the challenge.
If the problem was ignored, it would not just go away.
He felt that Governments should consider issuing something akin to a white paper counteracting Mr. Edmunds agreed that authorities could not feel confident that the rue bracts were available to the people if no effort was made to inform them of these facts.
He instanced publicity about the recommendations of the U. K Inter departmental Committee on Cannabis.
He asked by Mr Regan moved that the following recommendation of the Working arty be adopted: (a) There is no means of knowing how the information presented would be used or prohibition then this may produce the undesirable effect of leading to its rejection and the adoption of the very activity which it is intended to extinguish.

(i) the dissemination of factual material about specific activities which are being undertaken in relation to (ii) the provision of positive information about prevalence rates, educational needs, sources of consultation and facilities available to the community, etc.

in view of the immediate need to combat unfavourable publicity the recommendation is not sufficiently constructive.
They felt that Ministers should consider the issue of an authoritative white paper on the problem associated with narcotics and drugs of dependence, or at least to decide some positive steps that Some State Representatives also supported the issue of a white paper.
The Committee adopted the following recommendation of the The following groups in the community should have priority with regard to education about drugs of dependence: (i) Teachers, leaders of youth groups and other similar vironment and of detecting at an early stage the potential drug dependent.

Mental Health Aspects Dr. Wienholt in introducing the recommendation of the Health Working arty relaung to the collection of information about drug dependents., explained that the present system using the Bureau of Census and Statistics to collect and collate information was a basic system which would be expanded as required after discussions between the States and the Bureau.
The meeting agreed that the following recommendation be made to ''A programme is necessary to collect information about with similar action in the list of Prohibited Substances as defined and/or listed in Uniform Poisons Schedules of the National Health and Medical Research Council'.
co -operaton by the medical pracutoners and drug dependent patients with law enforcement authorities - ''Medical authorities including private practitioners should assist law enforcement agencies as far as practicable in tracking down illicit sources of drugs.
Patients should be encouraged to coy operate with the law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis.
However medical practitioners should not be obliged to make names of drug dependent patients available to Police and Customs authorities.
It was considered that information given to a central authority about patients dependent on drugs should not be readily available to law enforcement agencies as it would discourage patients from seeking and continuing under 8.2.2.
Treatment and Social Rehabilitation of Addicts On a majority vote the meeting decided that all the words after recommendation should be deleted.
The following recommendation was Services and should provide in patient, out patient and drug dependency as distinct from primary prevention is a medical matter, and programmes of treatment by dependents should be made under health legislation The Chairman recalled that at the previous meeting he had proposed to hand over to Health authorities certain functions now performed by Customs relating to the distribution of narcotic drugs.
The offer had been considered by the Health Working Party and he asked the Committee I to present its recommendations.
Dr. Macintyre stated that Tasmania would like Customs to assist with lnspeculon qduues on a continuing basis, particularly relating to data on narcotics to be sent to the United Nations.
What was needed also, was an administrative means of collecting centrally, data on the movement of both soft and hard drugs, presumably by Commonwealth Health.
Mr, Rogan said he regarded the need to collect and collate data on interstate transactions as urgent but inclusion of intrastate transactions needed more study.
Dr. Wienholt assured the Committee that his Department could cope with bon type or transactions.
He suggested that the terms of reference of the Health Working Party be changed to cover consideration of controls over licit transactions'' rather than ''interstate transactions'' as it was obvious that if the Working Party was to have a continuing function it would be looking at the whole field of control.
The Committee agreed to this amendment and to the following disseminate information on all interstate movements of drugs of dependence and that a Working Party be established to introduce such a system.
The Working Party should, at the same time, examine the feasibility, value and practicability of establishing a system to provide information on all aspects of the the collection and collation of information on licit transactions and relevant data to be disseminated to the department of Customs and seise and State n proposed that the Secretariat prepare a draft report to A members for approval as soon as possible by correspondence.
The Committee agreed to this course and to Dr. Woodruff's suggestion that the report should contain as attachments a copy of the summary records of the National Standing Control Committee meeting and report of Working Parties.
The Committee agreed to recommend to Ministers that the Standing Committee should meet every six months or more often if the It was resolved that formal sub committees should not be set up but that any area requiring attention should be handled by Working I I a a ATTACHMENT A NATIONAL STAND REPORT OF WORKING PARTY ON LEGISLATION The following recommendations were made with respect to the amend- A (a) it should be provided specifically in relation to the possession of prescribed drugs that a drug is deemed to be in the possession of a person if it is upon land or premises occupied by him or is used, enjoyed or controlled by him in any place whatever unless the person proves that he neither new nor had reason to suspect that he had a prescribed drug in his possess- by a person occupying or concerned with the manage- meant of premises where marihuana is smoked or otherwise used, unless the person proves that he neither knew nor had reason to suspect that marihuana was smoked or used in the premises; in paragraph b) should be provided in respect of other (d) it should be provided that a person is to be deemed to be trafficking in drugs if he is found in possession of more than a specified quantity of drugs, unless he proves that he neither knew nor had reason to suspect that he had the drugs in his possession or unless he proves that he was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking.

Penalties along these lines were adopted by the Commonwealth in the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 and the Customs Act 1967.
The Working Party noted that the only State in which indictable offences were prescribed with respect to the use of drugs was Victoria and that, in relation to summary offences, the maximum penalty prescribed in Victorian and Tasmanian law was only twelve months' imprisonment.

Sir William advised that due to pressing commitments during the morning session he would not be able to attend the meeting until after 12 The meeting was advised that the National Standing Control Committee on rugs of dependence had recommended that a Health Working Party be set up, under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Department of Health, to consider - The Standing Committee also recommended that the Convener should be requested to arrange for the relevant committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council to consider and report on certain matters to the first meeting of the Health 1.3 Reports of the Health Education Subcommittee and the Mental Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council were tabled and members were advised that the sgubstanece of these reports would, if endorsed by the meeting, be transmitted to the National Standing Control Committee as part of the report of the Health Working Party.
National Archives of Australia Tbhe report of the meeting of the Health Education Sub committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council which met 2.1 Matters referred to the Health Education Sub committee The Subcommittee had been asked to advise about educational measures in respect of drugs of dependence and abuse of drugs (i) education of the public at various levels such as - particularly to counteract undesirable publicity.
The Sub- committee discussed the complexity of the problems involved in the education of the various groups in the dependence and reported that in the Sub committee's I opinion there were no simple educational approaches, methods or techniques to cope with these problems effectively.
Problems discussed were in relation to school children, adolescents and young adults and specific groups of adults who occupied key positions in the community as far as education about drugs and the dissemination of information on drugs Were The Working Party agreed that emphasis should be directed towrards the young person and those who have significant influence over him.
It was considered necessary to promote accurate knowledge about all forms of drugs, to develop discriminating attitudes towards the use of therapeutic materials and to encourage the rejection of the use of stimulants, sedatives and narcotics.
This information should be directed at the child before he enters the phase of experi- mentation, or at any rate, of regular contact with a drug All health education programmes should focus on health and use and abuse of drugs, sexual promiscuity and venereal rather than campaigning only against drugs of dependence.
It was recommended that - RECOMMENDATION The elements of an education programme about the usages and occeasional abuse of drugs should be set into the general obiectives of a health education programme commencing before the This would include - (i) Teaching in schools and provision of and aids to instruction including films and social aspects of drug abuse and in discriminating consumer usage of drugs as part of the general health service training and in-service seminars and provision of teacher drug abuse is suspected.
Although it is inherently more difficult, there is also a need I to provide intensive education about drug abuse for those adolescents and young adults who have already begun to use drugs regularly for non-prescribed purposes and for those who are exposed to high risk.
Education programmes directed at these adolescents and young adults have already been introduced in a number of States in Australia.
The Working Party agreed that these programmes should be watched with interest.
2.5 Medical and allied professions I The Working Party agreed that education should be aimed at the professions to make them aware of the social rills involved.
It was recommended - I The attention of the appropriate education authorities should be drawn to the need for the teaching of social aspects associated with the use and abuse of drugs and partic- both at the undergraduate and postgraduate I I It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION The attention of the Pharmaceutical Association of Australia and State Pharmaceutical Societies be drawn to - The responsible role which pharmacists play in the community in relation to the distribution of drugs of dependence, education of the public and adequate security with respect to these drugs.
II It was considered that these people needed to be informed about the hazards associated with drugs and the most effective methods that could be used to educate people about these drugs.
The Working Party endorsed the action of the Health Education Sub- Committee in setting up a sub committee to prepare an authoritative document for these groups.
anal Archives of Australia 2.7 Officers of Child Welfare Departments and similar organisations The Working Party recognised that officers of these organisations dealing with youth have unique opportunities for contacting particular groups of young people who may be at risk in respect of drugs.
They have the opportunity of influencing these people and it is essential that they should be well informed about the hazards of drug taking and the most effective methods of educating people at risk.
The Working Party recognised that further areas where effective education may be carried out are parent and teacher associations.
The most effective means of educating these groups would be through a series of group discussions led by trained group leaders 2.9 Women of middle age who are at risk in relation to drugs of dependence There is a relatively high incidence of dependence on sedatives encountered in females of middle age.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION The attention of the National Council of Women and other appropriate organisations should be drawn to the problems which are common among women of middle age.
These can often lead to undue use of There is a need for positive action to be taken by the National Council of Women and other appropriate organisations to assist as many as possible of these women at risk. 2. 10 Training of key health education personnel It was recognised that a need exists for training courses in health education for a variety of health and education workers.
It was noted that dependence on drugs was a specifier area where there was a need for trained personnel in each of the States.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION Consideration should be given to the organisation of a residential training course of approximately two weeks duration for training key health education personnel from each of the States in the most effective educational methods with respect to drugs.
In relation to a co-ordinated press campaign to counteract publicity it was recommended - RECOMMENDATION No co-ordinated press campaign should be conducted to counteract - (a) There is no means of knowing how the information presented would be used or prohibition then this may produce the undesirable effect of leading to its refection and the adoption of the very activity which it is intended to some people may see the indulgence in drugs as constituting fashionable behaviour.
The Working Party saw the mass media as useful for - (i) the dissemination of factual material about specific aetiities which are being undertaken in relation to specific groups, and (ii) the provision of positive information about prevalence rates, educational needs, sources of consultation and facilities available to the community, etc.
It was felt that there may be considerable advantage in authorities handling educational activities in relation to drugs having frank discussions with representatives of the mass media when specific problems arise.
2.11.2 Health education films The Working Party noted that through the Health Education Subcommittee information was being collected from appropriate agencies in the States about the methods of using films, production and selection of suitable material for educational Having considered the total programme, the Working Party indicated those areas which they considered most important in order of It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION The following groups in the community should have priority with regard to education about drugs of and other similar people who have the dual role of disseminating factual information in a desirable educational environment and of detecting at an early stage the potentially drug dependent.
respect to their responsibility in 8. MENTAL HEALTH ASPECTS An extract from the report of the meeting of the Mental Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council The Committee considered the difficulties involved in carrying out research into drug dependence including the problems associated with the collection of information and agreed to use the definitions of dependence as set out in the Glossary of Mental disorders approved at the Sixty-fourth Session of the 3.1 Matters referred to the Committee The Committee was asked to consider health aspects with respect to drugs of dependence, and advise in particular about the following - (i) collection of information on and research into drug dependence; and 3.2 Collection of information and research into drug dependence 3.2.1
The Working Party agreed that there was a need for more and more accurate information about drug abuse.
It was noted that the standard collections of mental health statistics was currently being organised in all States in accordance with the programme developed by the National Health and Medical eseareh Council.
3. 2.2 Multiple cause coding of the causes of admission for psychiatries treatment was considered necessary to identify all patients with drug dependence.
In some cases drug dependence would be the secondary and not the primary diagnosis.
Normally, only the problems relating to mental health statistics would be studied by a small referencee committee of the 3.2.3
The list of drugs about which information should be collected was considered and it was recommended - RECOMMENDATION A programme is necessary to collect information about persons dependent on drugs in Schedule Eight of the Uniform curates, and also drugs with similar actions in the list of Prohibited Substances as defined and or listed in Uniform Poisons Schedules of the National Health and Medical Research Council.
Provisions in Commonwealth and State legislation relating to reporting of persons dependent on ''hard'' National Archives of Australia 3.2.5
The Working Party discussed the giving of inform matin about patients who are drug dependent.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION Medical authorities including private practitioners should assist law enforcement agencies as far as practicable in tracking down illicit sources of drugs.
Patients should be encouraged to co-operate with the law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis.
However medical practitioners ghoul not be obliged to make names of drug dependent patients available to olive and Customs authorities.
However it was considered that information given to a central authority about patients dependent on drugs should not be readily available to law enforcement agencies as it would discourage patients from seeking and continuing under treaty 8. 3 Education of medical and allied professions It was noted that a document entitled ''Modern Psychotropic rugs in Medical practice' has been prepared by a Working Party of the Mental Health Committee.
The National Health and Medical Research Council will be asked to approve and publish this document at its Session in May, 1969, so that it may be distributed to all medical practitioners and all A further document for the guidance of the medical and allied professions on the problem of dependence on drugs is I to be prepared by a working party of the Mental Health The Working arty considered that education in drug depend- envy at the undergraduate level could only be left to the Universities but the booklets mentioned may be of assistance in ensuring that the matter is adequately covered.
8.4 Treatment and social rehabilitation of addicts 3.4.1
The attention of the Working Party was drawn to the series of reports which have been produced by the It was agreed that special treatment facilities assisted certain cases and should be available in each State.
However, many, if not most cases, are best treated in association with the mainstream of psychiatric practice or when physical symptoms predominate, in the mainstream of general medicine.
Special facilities for the treatment of drug addicts and aleoholies are desirable and where they are established it was recommended - RECOMMENDATION tee A Facilities should be organised within the State Psyehiatrie Health Services and treatment of drug dependency as distinct from primary prevention is a medical matter and programmes of treatment by nonmedical agencies should be discouraged and should not be associated with youth 3.4.4
The Working Party agreed that over a long period, if patients can be supported adequately through frequent relapses, then there is a possibility of therapy being The majority of cases do respond to treatment, even if only temporarily and after care services are con In most of the sties of drug dependence therapy, there is little indication as to whether follow-up arrangements have been adequate.
8.4.5 Provision of facilities for after care treatment is poor in the Australian States and Territories and needs to be increased greatly within the Psychiatric Health Services.
As after care is the pivot on which successful therapy depends, the Working Party considered that it was essential that provision be made for facilities to enable this period of after care treatment of patients to be carried out.
The Working Party considered there should be legal provisions making it possible to detain persons depend- net on drugs for compulsory treatmnet under provisions similar to those in force in all States for the com It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION I Legal provisions for the compulsory detnetion of drug dependnets should be made under health legislation I The Commonwealth spheres of responsibility were outlined by the Commonwealth Departmnet of Health.
Commonwealth con troll over licit trade in narcotics is embodied in the Customs I are administered by the department of Customs and Excise.
These Acts provide for controls over narcotics down to and scalers and exporters are required to submit to Customs monthly returns which provide details of intra and interstate narcotic transactions.
Information in the monthly returns enables the Department of Customs and Excise to administer import and export quotas for the various narcotic drugs during a calendar year; and together with stock balances this is used as the basis of new quotas for the following calendar year.
Under the present system information on interstate disposals down to and including wholesale level could be provided to the States at monthly intervals without The Working Party was informed that at the meeting of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence held in Canberra on 7 March 1969 it was suggested that certain of the activities of the department of Customs and Excise in this area might be more appropriately handled by the Commonwealth department of Health, although the department of Customs and Exeise would wish to retain liaison with international authorities and be responsible for forwarding to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs the necessary data on licit and illicit transactions.
The National Standing Control Committee also considered it desirable that a service be provided whereby details of licit narcotise transactions could be disseminated to State and Territory health authorities.
A representative of the Department of Customs and Excise explained that his Department had examined the overall situation in Australia concerning licit controls over narcotics with a view to rationalising the situation as at present there is an overlap in controls exercised by the State authorities and his Department.
The Department of Customs and Excise considered that it was preferable to have a single authority handling the licit distribution of narcotics and thus offered to hand over to the State health authorities control of licit distribution including inspection of wholesalers, importers and manufacturers of formulated products.
The Department of Customs and Excise wish to retain the function of inspects a of these activities would be the responsibility of the Common- wealth Department of Health.
The Ddepartment of Customs and Excise was prepared to vacate the inspection activities and leave these to the relevant It was appreciated that withdrawal from the inspection field may create undue burdens on State health ddepartments and therefore the department of Customs and Exeise has offered to assist and if necessary conduct joint inspections for the first twelve months.
n future data which has customarily been forwarded to the Department of Customs and Excise would now be supplied to the Commonwealth Department of Health in its role as The Working Party unanimously agreed to proposals that licit A controls over narcotic drugs be transferred to Health epart- 4.2 Central Information Bureau on licit transactions The Working Party considered the merits of providing an efficient recording and processing system.
It was suggested that such a system should be reapable of rapidly - and that any inconsistencies should immediately be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.
It was further considered that such a service could not be provided to cover all drugs of dependence without adequate computer facilities and that unless a simple system could be evolved for the collection of necessary input data such a scheme would be so time consuming, complex and costly as to be impracticable.
Preliminary investigation indicated that such data could be collected without creating an excessive burden on various segments of industry and the professions.
National Archives of Australia Al States agreed that provision of information on interstate transactions was desirable, some were also of the opinion that information on intrastate transactions would be valuable.
t was agreed that information be provided on transactions down to and including wholesale level.
ra The vale and desirability of extending this beyond wholesale level was not determined.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION 1) That a working party be established to investigate the feasibility, value and practicability of providing a system seminate information on all licit trans- actions of narcotise and possibly other drugs of dependence.
undertake the collection and collation of information on licit transactions and relevant data be disseminated to the Department of Customs and Excise and State Health Departments.
4.8 Proposed international controls on psychotropic drugs The Working Party was provided with a document which detailed the proposed international controls of psychotropic The background which had led to the preparation of this document was outlined.
t was noted that the latest draft of the protocol would not be available from the United Nations for approximately three weeks, but would be distributed to States for comments as soon as possible.

The Committee would have to decide if there were going to be sub- sidiary committees, such as Working Parties.
He said that because the function of the Committee was to advise Ministers he considered no Press Publicity should be given to the proceedings.
It was so agreed.
Dr Macintyre said that the Committee's first task was to define what was required to be done to meet the Ministers' wishes, the facilities available in carrying out the Ministers' wishes and the time table for achieving it and what Committees were required.
The Chairman then outlined the functions of the Standing Committee as en of what further steps could be taken by the Commonwealth and States together, to combat all aspects of the drug problem in Australia and to make recommend- actions to Ministers on legislation and administrative action which should be Agenda Item 2-Law Enforcement The Chairman said Commonwealth and State Leglslation to combat illicit raricng was enforced by the Customs Narcotic Bureau and State Ppolice Drug Squads with Commonwealth police having no operational role, being responsible for analysis of narcotise offences in the overall survey of crime As investigactions by different agencles were frequently interwoven there was a definite need for greater liaison at the working level and for the dissemination of all available information to each operative agency.
This type of co-operation was now taking place in New South Wales between Police and Customs and there was a need to extend this on a Commonwealth basis.
Mr Carmody said that he had given extensive consideration to the matter and had come to the conclusion that the most efficient means of ensuring complete co-operation was by the interchange of offerers between Customs and Police in all States.
The information and intelligence records of the Narcotics Bureau would be made available to police and vice versa and combined legal powers could be utilized.
Several delegates requested working details of this proposal.
It was agreed that these would be determined at a later date if the proposal Was accepted in principle at the next meeting after delegates discussed the matter with their own administration.
Both Supt Calder and Inspector Burrows pointed out that they did not consider full time interchange of officers was warranted at this stage in their States.
Future developments could however alter the National Archives of Australia It was agreed that the proposal was deserving of the closest study and that the following recommendation be recorded - The Standing OCcommittee notes with satisfaction the offer of the Comptrollers General of Customs to attach a Narcotics Officer to each State Police Drug The committee recommends that States examine this proposal to determine the need for such attachments and their practicability in their respective situations and to report back to the next meeting.''
The Chairman said Ministers at their initial meeting had all stressed the need or a central source of information on both illicit and licit activities.
Such source must collate, evaluate and disseminate data from all sources of offenders and suspects, suppliers, addicts, sources of supply and other allied a matters.
To operate efficiently this central agency should have access to details of the import, export, manufacture and distribution of narcotise drugs and other drugs of dependence.
In addition it should be aware of ship and aircraft movements and have access to records of their crews and cargoes I and details of goods through parcels post.
These were the accepted points of entry of illicit drug imports.
The Department of Customs and Excise exercises statutory contact with I the United Nations to fulfil Australia's commitments under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
Its Narcotics Bureau had established close liaison with corresponding agencies overseas, particularly in South East Asia.
It could therefore successfully operate a central information agency in all matters assessment of crime generally.
No State finance would be required for operation of the Customs Bureau.
es said a Central Drug Bureau was operated by the New South Wales Polio Thig was essentially concerned with police operations and did not include vital data from health authorities.
A forthcoming conference of OCommissioners of police would discuss the matter and could influence any des casion on the present subject by ppolice authorities.
Mr Emunas spoke of the need for information on drug trafficking to be evaluated as part of the overall assessment of organide crime in ustrali.
Mr lllon said the establishment of a central drug information and intelligence centre at this time should be with a view to adaptation to computer operation in the future.
Such would permit easy access to the information by all The Chairman said that if the Customs Bureau was to be utilized, the Department would provide telex lines to all police drug squads.
differing opinions were expressed concerning which Commonwealth Department should operate the central drug information bureau.
The following 'There should be established immediately a National Drug Intelligence bureau to collate and disseminate information to all law enforcement bodies, but when the Commonwealth establishes and has working a Central Crime Intelligence function should be carried out by that Bbureau.
In the interim, immediate steps should be taken to utilise the Bureau within the department of Customs and excise to disseminate operational intelligence on drugs of final Archives of Australia It was supported by the Commonwealth representatives.
It was agreed that this proposal should be considered by State auth- orities for discussion at the next meeting of the Standing Committee.
The Chairman explained that the Customs department had the existing link with overseas drug agencies.
The Victorian Police had the Interpol contact.
Customs send information to lInterpol through Melbourne.
t was stated that there should be more active participation by Australian authorities including State authorities in overseas conferences and The Chairman said that if effective co-ordination of activities was achieved he I was prepared to recommend that State people be considered for attendance at such meetings at Commonwealth expense.
I Mr Edmunds considered that we should look at the question of possession of drugs and the position of the occupier of premises on which drugs are found.
He said that two recent decisions in England had injected a requirement of mens era into the concept of possession.
Both States and the Commonwealth would have to examine their legislation on possession in the light of these This may be an appropriate area to apply the ''reverse onus'' device.
Although there were political difficulties, if Commonwealthy/ States agreed these could possibly be overcome.
He wondered whether the Committee should consider categorising different drugs with different penalties.
He felt that Ministers would need to say something on this aspect before very long.
