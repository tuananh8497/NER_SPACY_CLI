The chairman called for comments on the reports of the Education Sub Committee.
In opening the discussion he stated that one section of the report was unsatisfactory, in that no attempt had been made to assess the efficacy of the programmes or the needs of the States for funds, in accordant with the terms of reference of the Sub- Committee.
He felt that it was one of the primary functions of the.
Sub -Committee which they had neglected.
they were asked to sit in judgement on each other's programmes.
He felt that the Committee needed some guidance, perhaps with the support of an additional Sub -Committee.
The Chairman then announced that approval had been given in advance year.
He did not deny the difficulties with which the subcommittee was faced but he considered that it was its purine function to advise on programmes and allocation of funds.
The Chairman asked whether there were any further comments on the reports of the Education Sub Committee.
Mr Rogen emphasised the necessity of grants to voluntary.
organisations being allocated through the State programmes rather than on a direct basis from the Commonwealth.
He instanced a recent Court case where Buoyancy claimed that it received direct Commonwealth support, to the embarrassment of his Department.
National Archives ofAustralia Dr. Hsnholt asked Mr. Rogan to report in writing on this situation for the information of Commonwealth Ministers.
In a reply to a question from Pr Moodruff he stated that the grant, which had been name, was an isolated case and that it was unlikely that a similar situation would arise again.
The Chairman referred to the Sub Committee's statement that programmes were being frustrated by the lack of guarantee from the Commonwealth of the continuance of funds.
Mr. Rimes indicated that this comment was not intended to be soritical, but rather to emphasise the difficulties of obtaining suitably trained staff when unable to guarantee them continuity of The hearten suggested that, in view of the lack of guidance from the Education Sub Committee, the allocation of funds for 1972/5 should be the same as for 1971/2.
Mr Strutton asked watcher any consideration had been given to making the allocations on a population basis.
The Chairman said that there were a number of basic reasons gainst such an allocations the principal one being that the smaller States would be badly disadvantaged.
allocation provided some allowance was made for the special problems experienced by the less populous States.'
He also queried the Common- wealth's allocation, asking that it be reviled along with the States.
In this he was supported by Pr odruEE.
National Archives of Australia Eommonmealth Department of Health should assume responsibility for the production of films, pamphlets and publicity material for distribution to the States.
Be said however, that State Ministers could raise the matter at the inert meeting of ministers if they so PR Hienholt assured the Committee that the bulk of the Common- wealth allocation was used as outlined by the Chairman.
He gave the following details in respect of proposals for 1972/3 e Seminars Films Printing A N U. Research project Film and book reference library for journalists.
Mr Strutton emphasised that the formula used for allocation of funds for 192 had greatly disadvantaged N.S.W. and Queensland.
Because these States had established drug education programmes prior to Commonwealth funds being available, their submissions had emphasised the salary content of their programmes.
This had resulted in a lower allocation.
Should this basis of allocation continue in 1972/3, he felt their disadvantage would be compounded.
Ehe Chairman stressed that the total allocation was 85OO, 000, and that this amount should be allocated on the basis of relative priority needs as reflected by the pro jetes proposed by the individual States.
National Archives of Austalia He appreciated that the States had built up meaningful programmes but, to the extent that their needs exceeded the amount of money available, some reduction in their programmes would be necessary.
A number of proposals was then considered for allocating the fund.
After much discussion it Mas agreed, with victoria and W.A. dissenting, after first deducting the Commonwealth's requirement and an amount of s30.000 for distribution among the smaller States The final allocation was as follows - Vvictoria Queensland Tasmania The Chaen said that the Conronwealth was satisfied that the above allocations were based on the needs of the carious States.
The Chairman indicated that this item arose as a result of a query from the Commonwealth Audit, and asked Dr. Wienholt to comment.
Dr.ienholt stated that it was recognised that the omership of assets purchased from Commonwealth funds rested with the States.
However, in order to satisfy the requirement of Commonwealth Audit, it was essential that any proceeds from the sale of such assets should be directed towards replacement or other activities within the State drug education programmes.
He stated that the Commonwealth would write to the States on this matter.
National Archives of Australia Agenda Item 1(d) - Membership of Education Sub Committee The Chairan stated that membership of the Sub Cormittee was due for review in September.
The Commonwealth had no firm proposals at this stage, but would appreciate hearing views of the States.
Calder felt that in any reconstruction of the Sub Committee some consideration should be given to the inclusion of a law enforcement Mr Pillon Agreed with this proposal, adding that to representatives from the law enforcement authorities would be preferable.
The Chairman said that this would be recorded as a request, and commented that the Committee was too large and should be more functional.
Pr Hiemhnlt indicated that the Sub Committe was te ee appointed jointly by the Ministers for Customs and Excise and Health, and requested Committee members to submit their views in writing on the structure of the Sub -Committee by the end of July.
Agenda Item 2 Media Working Part The Chairman referred to the successful seminar on Drugs and the Hass Hedia held in Canberra in February, and stated that a working party set up to establish a form of liaison between the educators and the media had met on 5 May, and submitted the following recommendations for consideration: 1) A national media advisory committee to be set up following a one-day conference of key members of N.S.C.C. with representatives of media ii) Continuation of present State drug education advisory committees with some press representatives; iii) Media advisory subcommittees at State levels to consist of a representative from each of the media sections to be the link between drug education information sources and the media.
Mr. Rimes moved that the recommendations of the working party be The Chairman stated that the Commonwealth would arrange for a top level conference with members of the media.
National Archives of Australia independent action by the States.
The halrmar referred to the report of the working party, and the fact that the N S.C.C. had agreed that a pilot study should be PE Mienholt said that no action had been taken to develop the pilot study at this stage.
The Commonwealth would write to the States requesting their Suggestions for this development, as a preliminary to obtaining funds, Mr Dimes indicated that N.S .W. would prefer not to go ahead with Pans at the present time.
Ar Rogan said that he would have discussions with his officers and contact the Commonwealth Department of Health as soon as possible.,
The cheirgg etatad that it was important to Proceed Mith the proposals as n proper knowledge of the ertent of the problem would agist in determining an effective approach to drug education and the provision of more meaningful statistics for fulfilling our obligation to the United Nations.
agenda Item 4 Treatment and Rehabilitation Pr lienhold said that the States had submitted their views in relation to the paper prepared by the Mental Hemlth Conmittee of the of Health that the question of treatmant and rehabilitation could not be considered outside the ental health programme generally and would prefer to have it discussed in the forthcoming review of mental health arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States.
He felt it should be removed from this Committoe's deliberations.
Mr Ro However, r woodruff said that it was important for health and law enforcement authorities and the N.S.C.C. to be kept informed of developments in this area.
r Strutten printed out that the matter had been raised at the Commonwealth and State Health Ministers' Conference but had not been discussed because of the proposals before the N.S.C.C. Prs SnOm advised that a W.A. Parliamentary Select Committee had been appointed to enquire into the treatment and rehabilitation of drug dependent persons.
It was agreed that the N.S.C.C.
Should report to linisiters that treatment and rehabilitation was subject to separate consideration by several committees reporting to the Health various anti drug measures had raised the question of the feasibility of using a computer model to determine dmamic effects of various anti - drug measures, as devised by Professor Forester of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He said that the Commonwealth Department of Health had pursuit the matter and found that Prof. Forester's work was concerned with the effect of many factors upon human society and the world environment.
As drug abuse appeared to be only a very small part o an input of numerous social issues, it was considered that Prof. Forester'e model was too complex to apply to our needs.
Agenda Item 6 Methadone Maintenance The Chairman referred to an approach which had been made to Customs concerning persons on a methadone maintenance programme arriving in Australia as tourists.
National Archives of Australia.
Dr lienhold put the view that, if such a situation should arise, the person concerned should be permitted to retain 3 days' supply and be advised to report immediately to the State Health Department.
Customs officers would have the responsibility to report the presence of such persons to a nominated officer in the State Health Department who would arrange for the continuation of the treatment.
He further stated that appropriate arrangements should be made for the advice of movements between the States of such temple.
Agree Agenda Item Importation of Hallucinogens The Chairman said that, since 1967, importations of certain dangerous hallucinegens, such as I90, had been permitted only if imported by Government authorities.
The number of hailuginogeng under Imsort Control had greatly increased and included - a) dangerous hallucinogens, such as LSD and mescaline; The Health Working Party on monitoring had discussed this matter and made the following recommendations: 4) The Commonwealth Department of Health, while currently examining the lists of substances shown in the Department of Customs and Excise General Orders, will bring to the attention of the Poisons Schedule Sub -Cormittee those i) The Hoisons Schedule subcommittee be asked te indicate the Scnedule classification of each substance, taking into account the information to be provided by the Commonwealth Department of Health.
P iemholt commented that this was one of the most difficult evaluations to ask pharmacologists to undertake.
They are erperiencing for their recommendations regarding the scheduling of these It was agreed that the recommendations of the worlin Part as eet out above Pe adoPted.
The Ehairman stated that this item had been placed on the agenda to alert States to their role in providing statistics on Psychotropic Substances for purposes of reporting to the United latinos.
A further important consideration was the necessity for an appropriate body to prepare a list of erempt preparations.
He then eked Mr lwatson to comment on the question of ratification of the Psychotropic Substances Mr, watson considered that it was essential for the legal authorities of both the State and the Commonwealth to assist Health Departments in determining what amendments, if any, would need to be affected before Australia cpuld proceed to ratification.
Involvement of the Law Departments in the deamination of legislation would mean a saving in time and would enable the Commonwealth to rely on the authority of the survey.
a ies said that New South Wales would not be in a position amendments to their legislation.
Nc Eegsg indicated that victoria would have a staff problem in supplying the necessary information and wondered if it would be possible The Chairgan pointed out that Australia had a responsibility to produce these statistics no tater what the difficulties were.
Dr Hienholt suggested the possibility of enlisting the support of the National Council of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries on the collection of statistics with a vim to seeing what use could be made of the monitoring system.
() The Poisons Schedule Sub-Conmittee of the N.H. and M.R.C. be requested to prepare a list of exempt preparations in accordance with the requirements of the Convention and (ii) A worming party comprising representatives from Commoneealth Health, Customs, New South Wales and Victoria meet with the National Couneil of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries to discuss the question of collection of statistics on psychotropic substances.
Aenda Item 9 Amendments to Single Convention The hairma referred to the concise summary of proposed amendments to the Single Convention which had been circulated to members.
He asked delegates to examine the proposals carefully so that when a formal approach was made to State Governments concerning ratification of the Protocol an early reply could be forwarded.
Agenda Item 10 Regional Conference on Drug Trafficking The Chairman referred to the report on the regional Conference on Drug Traffickingg which had been given at the last meeting and stated that Australia had taken the initiative concerning the holding of a follow-up conference.
He said that the holding of such a meeting was highly desirable and all possible steps were being taken to see that a meeting took place without overplaying Australia's role.
Specialist Training for Law Enforcement Officers The Cbirm referral to the fact that it had racently been necessary for Customs and for the Tasmanian Polics to hold training courses in the area of drug enforcement.
Whilst he believed that the general training being carried out by the Commonwealth Police was fulfilling its purpose he felt that there was a need for other anthorities to hol specialised training erercises ln such cases theirs was merit in giving other law enforcement agencies an opportunity to participate should they so desire.
National Archives of Australia Mr. Hatson said that it had been agreed that the Commonwealth Police should conduct such training courses and he believed that the syllabus for these courses indicated that more than general training was involved.
He stated that if the courses were not fulfilling the desired need he would welcome eny comments.
Mr Dillon stated there was no doubt that the national course was very valuable and strongly supported its continuance.
As for the local courses he said that if the need arose victoria would fill it and the course would be open to attendance by officers from other law enforcement agencies.
Pet Sste Abbott agreed with Mir.
Dillon and said that the rational Course must be continued.
e said there was merit in the suggestion that it be extended to include overseas personnel but there were some problems which would need to be overcome.
In New South Males a number of entraining courses were conducted which were not specifically directed to the field of drugs.
It ae agreed that the National Courses conducted by the Commonwealth Police should continue and that if possible these should be portended to include overseas personnel.
The principal of holding courses to fit the needs of local law enforcement authorities was accepted and it was agreed that the opportunity would be given for officers from other agencies to attend as appropriate.
However in any notification of courses it should be made clear at what level they are so that correct assessments of their usefulness and place in the training structure can be made.
Agenda Item 12 - Poppy Cultivation in Tasmania LEs Eots reported that the Poppy Advisory and Control Board had been set up as a subcommittee of the Poisons Advisory Committee established under the Poisons Act, Tasmania, 1971.
The functions of the Board were to: National Archives of Australia (a) devise on and control all matters relating to the cultivation, production and transport of opium poppies and poppy material; (b) collect and collate statistical information and prepare (e) to liaise with the appropriate Commonwealth Department in the matter of obligations under the International Drug Agenda Item 13 Security of Movement The Chairman advised that the report of the Working Party on Transport Security has been referred to the National Eherapeutic Goods Co mitten for eramination in conjunction with the Code of Cood Manufacturing Practices.
The report would be considered by the August meeting of the Agenda Item 4 Supnly of Drugs to Ships The Ehirman advised that the Worsing Party had not yet finalised its report and that it would be circulated to members for written comment as soon as it became available.
The Chairman referred to the previous meeting where States had been asked to submit reports on the operation of the monitoring system.
He said that the Working Party had reviewed these reports and recommended that the system be continued.
P. Wignholt agreed with the recommendation for continuation of the monitoring system adding that the Commonwealth would have wished to continue in any case.
He commented that the information was available to the States to use as they saw fit. the taairmnan mentioned the previous recommendation made by the N.S.C.C., in relation to research and stated that it had lapsed for a number of reasons.
He referred to the grants which had been made by the N H. and Mi.R.C. and commented that he felt more research should be carried outs Pr Mienholt stated that the Prime Minister had recently announced an increase in research funds from J6 million to i3.5 millionths for the next triennium.
Of these funds a total of 2 .69 million would be directed towards research into social problems and it mas likely that drugs mould be included in this area.
In vim of this he felt that there was no further need for research to be discussed by the N.S.C.C. and the matter could be left to the NH.
M..C. Mre Himes agreed with this approach.
He then referred to Er. Chesher's research on cannabis and stated that an application had been made by Dr. Chesher to carry out research using human volunteers He hoped that in this matter the Commonwealth would not take any action without consultation with his State.
Dr. Hienholt Suggested that all requests for approval to carry out research using human volunteers should be vetted by the N.H. and M R.C. even though the actual project may not be MHr.
MCCarthy stated that on his recent trip to Canada he had been advised that the Camadians were opting out of research on cannabis.
He said that they felt there was so much research going on im the Umited States in this area that they were not prepared to mast their funds on duplicated efforts.
now considered the question of research on human beings was a complex one involving legal technicalities.
He suggested the Oonmonwealth should contact the States to ascertain chloral position.
He doubted whether it would be legal to use cemnabis for human research in Western Australia.
The Chairman pointed out that this was an item which should be considered at the next Minister's meeting.
It was agreed that where the States received an application involving a research prosect using human volunteers, the matter would be referred to the Commonwealth Department of Health for referral to the Medical Research Advisory Committee of the H.H. G M.R.C. for advice.
Agenda Item 17 - Distribution of Narcotic Samples The Chairman stated that the Commonwealth Department of Health had extracted figures relating to the distribution of narcotic samples Dr Mienholt said that in his view the number of samples currently being issued was small and no action was warranted at this stage.
However, State officers should be encouraged to frown on any increased activity in this regard.
Mre Rimes said that New South Wales was prepared to ban their distribution entirely if the meeting agreed.
Mr Rotts advised that the legislation in Tasmania did not allow medical practitioners to import or receive narcotic samples and he felt it would automatically cut out in that State.
Be supported prohibition or some other form of control particularly in view of the World Health Organisation's recommendation on the subject.
Dr. Woodruff suggested that an approach to the National Council of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries would assist in keeping the distribution of narcotic samples to a minimum.
P Etrick supported this view adding that it would be preferable to discourage distribution at this stage rather than to legislate against it.
National Archives of Australia It was agreed that the Commonwealth Department of Health told approach the Hational Council of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries on the question of distribution of narcotise samples and report back to the next meeting.
The Chairmen commented that the percentage of drugs stolen when related to total quantities transacted at the retail level was significant and that the actual quantity stolen represented a very large number of doses on the illicit market.
He asked whether anything further could be done to discourage thefts of this nature.
surgeries and 62 pharmacies had been broken into.
There had been an increase in earned holdups and in thefts from doctor's surgeries but a drop in thefts from pharmacies.
He felt that everything possible had been done in this regard.
Dr Uoodruff said that in South Australia retail pharmacists hold no stocks of amphetamines and very limited stocks of narcotics.
Doctor's surgeries also held minimum quantities of these drugs.
This had been done by arrangements with the people concerned and consequently there were relatively few instances of thefts from these places in South Dr. lienhold expressed the view that he believed that large numbers of doctors and chemists were still holding stocks in excess of their requirements.
The Chairnan asked if it would be appropriate for each of the doctors and pharmacists to be written to pointing out the statistics and seeking their cooperation. .
Mr Eotts said that Tasmania had introduced a system whereby all mharmncists had to report their transactions to the Henlth Department This gave them a basis for talking to those with recess stocks and was having the desired effects.
It was agreed that each State would write to the appropriate State organisations pointing the statistics relating to stolen dru and seeking their co-operation.
The Commonwealth would take the .
matter up with the Federal bodies concerned.
Pr. woodruff referred to previous discussions on this subject stating that South Australia had legislated making it an offence to use a hypodermic syringe for an unlawful purpose.
He said that recently one of the Judges in South Australia had dream attention to the ease with which hypodermic syringes and needles were made availably to anyone wishing to purchase without a prescription.
The judge made the comment that he would have thought chemists had some responsibility in this regard.
Dr. Woodruff asked whether the Conmittee had any other views on the matter.
Fe limens indicated that New South Wales intended to amend its act in line with South Australia.
He could not see that anything further could be done.
Pet Sst Seehion said that there was no legislation in Tasmania but considered that it would need to be looked at and greco emendations made to the appropriate authorities.
General discussion followed and it was agreed that it was not appropriate at this stage to place any controls over the sale of hypodermic syringes and needles.
The Chairman advised that the next meeting of Ministers had been set down for Friday, 1t August at 9.30 a.m. in Adelaide.
National Archives of Australia i He said that Mr. Chipp would write to the Ministers concerned and the report to Ministers would be circulated for approval as soho as possible.
He suggested that the following matters could be placed on the agenda for the meeting: (g) report on the activities of the m.S.c.C. () overall review of the effectiveness of erpenditure on drug education; The Chairan suggested the possibility of a further meting in September primarily to review the terms of reference and the constitution of the Drug Education Sub Committee.
Mre Rimes put the proposition that this subsect should be discussed at the inert meeting of Ministers.
Ehe suggestion from New South Wales on the composition of the sub committee would te at least one person from each State and two law enforcement officers.
It was agreed that the question of the role and composition of the ducetion ub Committee be submitted for discussion at the inert meeting of Mimisters.
States who wished to forward comments in this regard were asked to do so by middle of July.
It was agreed that the next meeting of the N.S .C.C. would be held in abeyance at this stage.

ADDRESSED TO THE secretary lith April ?
I refer to your letter of the d Rebruay, 1972 in remark to the working of the Monitoring System on Drugs of Dependence in this State, and as requested the following report is submitted.
Following preliminary meetings of a Worling Party of the National Stending Control Comittee on Drugs of Dependence, the monitoring scheme came into operation as a pilot scheme in Victoria and Tasmania on Prior to this time, Victoria had required under the Drugs of Addiction and restricted Substances Regulations that manufacturers and wholesalers furnish a quarterly return of all transactions in drugs of addiction and this return was furnished in a wide variety of forms of retuurn from which very little meaningful information could be retrieved.
These forms did, however, serve as e guide to the Worling Party as to the magnitude of the work which would be involved.
After the successful anl largely uneventful phasing in of the scheme in Victoria and Tesmania, which incidentally was carried out mirth the full co-operation of the pharmaceutical industry, the monitoring system was subsequently phased in to all States of the Commonwealth.
It is true to say that during 1970 and the rely part of 197 that little was achieved in the way of the supply of worthwhile data.
However, as the commonwealth Health Department computer section devisat further programmes with respect to the infarction being supplied, they were able, early in 1971, to commence providing information which was important to licit drug control programmes, As stated previously, full advantage of the information being supplied will not be obtained until the necessary field stuff has been appointed to carry out the followr-up action necessary.
Considerable value will be gained from the provision by ths Commonwealth of computer print-outs with respect to either chemist, doctor or other authorized person or company who obtains above nom quantities of drugs on e basis lied down after discussion with all Stntes of the Commonmealth.
Officers of the Poisons Division have taken the opportunity to utilise much of the information supplied in other aspects of poison end drug ctontrol, e.g, the follow up of persons or companies who hold no qualifications, permits, licences or arthritis; the follow up of materials lost or destroyed; the keeping in manufacturing or wholesale establishments only material currently being manufactured and sold and the retaliation of the extent of detailing and samplings of drugs of dependence.
In addition to safes or vaultlike storage for drags of addiction, the necessity of separate licences to handle drugs of addiction and the use of qualified staff, the computer system has acted as a deterrent to the mushrooming of numerous narcotic outlets.
To sum up, it is believed that this system has served and ill serve a very useful purpose in the control of drugs of addiction and the A furnishing of necessary statistics for the completion of reports, edges a Australia's Annual Beport to United Mations on Narcotic Drugs.
if Officers of this Department were of the opinion that the scheme waste of time, money and effort if the scheme were to be abandoned just as it is, I believe, about to produce infomuation, which will greatly assist our drug control programmes.
i The computer personnel of the Commonmealth Health Department should be highly commended for the manner in mich they have devised prPrammes for the receipt and comnpilstion of the material being supplied to them.

As grants will soon be made to the States for their third year of activities, it is desirable for sone arrangements to be made with the States concerning capital assets.
Although ownership of assets rests with the States, it should be noted that assets purchased from Commonwealth funds are for use in drug education programmes end that any proceeds from their sale should be directed towards the cost of replacement or towers other activities in the State Programme.
States are required to furnish annual statements of expenditure certified by their respective Auditors-General and it is considered that these statements would be sufficient to ensure that Commonwealth instructions retarding assets are carried out by State authorities.
National Archives of Australia Members will recall discussions at the meeting of the National Stending Control Committee on 3 July 4970 concerning the setting un of the Drug Educaticn subcommittee.
At this meeting, it was agreed that it would be desirable to place a tenure of to years on the appointments to the subcommittee.
The membership of the Sub-Cormittee is due for relic: At the Meeting of Ministers on 24 April 1970, it hd been agreed that the nucleus of the subcommittee would come from outside experts and community opinion-leedersg as well as representatives from appropriate Commonwealth Departments.

Subsequently, the folloming recommendation was adopted: '(1) Facilities gheuld be organised within the State Heglth Services ad should provide in patients The treatment of drug dependency as distinct from primary preventing is a medical matter, and prOglalnes of treatment by nonmedical agencies should be discouraged.
(ii) Legel provisions for the compulsory detent of drug dependents should be made tuner health it was agreed that the following recommendation be submitted to the National Standin Control Committee: ''In the absence of precise information on treatment and rehabilitation services throughout Australia, the Health Worlin Party reeommens that a part of an overall research programme, an investigation be carried out into these facilities in each State to determine the situation, bearing in mind the study currently being conducted in Wew South Wales.''
This recommendation was endorsed by the National Standing Control Committee on 3 April 1970.
Advice was sought from the Mental Health Committee regarding appropriate persons or organisations to undertake these investigations in each State and the manner in which such studies could be most effectively and conveniently undertaken.
The ental Health Committee provided the following The most appropriate organisations for obtaining and evaluating information on treatment and rehabilitation services for drug dependency in each State mould be the State departments of Mientl The matter was again discussed by the mental Heaslth Committee on 2 Harch 1974, when it was agreed that members would prepare a working paper for consideration at their next meeting.
At the Mental Health Committee meeting on 2-35 Sentember 1971, the paper was discussed and revised and submitted to the National Standing Control Committee as a dcument suitably expressing the Committee's views.
This working paper, ''Treatment and Rehabilitation of Drug Dependent Persons'', (a copy of which is attached) was presented to the meeting of the rational Standing Control Cemmittee on 22 September 197t.
At this meeting, State members were requested to examine the paper an forrard their torments to ihe Commonealth Department of Health.
At the meeting of the Hational Standing Control Committee on 9 February, it was noted that only N.S .;',
had sent in States were reminded at the last meeting of the Mental Health Committee on 15-16 March 1972 that their views were required on the paper.
To date the following replies have been NatonalArchives of Australia The report of the Mental Health Committee provides a ground frameork for the development of a treatment and rehabilitaticr programme for drug dependent persons.
They recommend that the Coiorwrealth Government should consider as a matter of urgency the Senate Select Committee recommendation that 5 million dollar be made available immediately The report provides suitable muidielines.3

being dependent on the availability of adequate finance.
They recommend that the Hational Standing Control Committee examine this document and the recommendations contained in the Charter on the Prevention and Treatment of Alcoholism (adopted at the 1972 Australian Health ministers Conference) as well as the Senate Select Committee recommendation that S5 million Agrees in principle with the document.
At the last Health Ministers' Conference it was agreed that the National Standing Control Comittee consider the provisic of treatment and rehabilitation for drug addicts at its next APPENDIX II MENTAL HEALTH COMMITTEE DEPENDENT PERSONS t.t Any programme initiated in the field of drug dependence must have unbuilt evaluation.
In such a difficult field, where change in pattern and volume is the rule rather than the exception, flexibility is essential and staff employed must be adaptable.
Such vital issues as the following require to be demonstrated: (a) the criteria of successful administrative and preventative action; (b) which methods of treatment are really successful; (c) what modalities, once established will be adequately utilised by the drug dependent population.
Solutions can only be expected if ae strict monitoring system is incorporated at the outset.
It would not be necessary, and indeed would be unwise, to build an organisation entirely separate from and unrelated to the comprehensive mental health services now being developed.
Although some special services will be needed, many of the constituent modalities required are already in existence and will require minimal expansion to encompass the management of the drug dependent Although from available data it is obvious that the need for action in the field of drug dependence appears to have become urgent, any estimate of actual incidence and prevalence is speculative and subjective.
If adequate programmes are to be mounted and, perhaps even more important, their efficiency is to be gauged, accurate incidence and prevalence data are essential.
One advantage of a non-legalistic approach to the drug dependent person would be the possibility of compulsory notification to health authorities.
Action has been taken by the Mental Health Committee to convene a Working Party to devise a systemm of recording data and the advisability of compulsory notification is to be considered by the Working National Archives of Austalia In any case some system of collection, processing, recording and recall of data will have to be devised.
This data collection must incorporate statistics from all agencies concerned with those who abuse drugs.
The statistics collected by established health agencies represent only one highly selected portion of the whole.
Contrawise, statistics offered by other agencies frequently lack the preciseness of definition essential to objective assessment of the problem.
Staff occupying key positions must be carefully selected and trained.
The basic attitude and expectations of the care-giver are known to have a bearing on the outcome of management.
As long as staff reflect authoritarian and rejecting community attitudes, perpetuation of the present frustrating situation must be expected.
Prior to inauguration of services it will be necessary to provide training programmes paying particular attention not only to the content of the courses but also to the methodology of training.
Although there is a growing body of information concerning all aspects of drug dependency, there is a significant hiatus regarding the local scene.
It would, therefore, be essential that some of the professional workers in the.
field were actively encouraged to spend a portion of their time engaged on research including research designed to evaluate programmes.
2. The essential elements of a service are seen as follows: centres and primary contact centres.
hsalth consultation and community organisation.
particularly if Methadone therapy is to be utilised.
National Archives of Australia.
(i) voestional training aimed at acquisition of basic work habits and marketable skills.
(iii) On-going psychotherapy for a limited number of patients both in group and individual settings.
Opportunity to enjoy leisure time activity divorced from the drug culture.
xvii) Living accommnodation of a permanent nature away from the drug scene.
In the prison medical services some duplication of certain of these elements will be necessary for those drug dependent persons who have been apprehended for commission of offences.
2.2 Assessment Centres Two different types of assessment centre are required: (a) Office, or clinic settingspreferably in the central city, to which drug dependent people could be referred by the courts, medical practitioners, voluntary organisations, ete.
The major activity at this type of centre would be rapid assessment with the objective of referring the client to the appropriate management facility.
(b) Inpatient assessment centre where patients could be admitted for periods of up to four weeks if necessary, for a thorough examination of all relevant aspects or their problem and the formulation of a realistic longs term management plan.
Opinions vary as to the extent to which detoxification centres should be provided and as to whether alcoholic and other drug dependent persons should be treated together.
The provision of detoxification for alcoholics involves a substantial change in social policy and the transfer of a considerable case load from the police to a medical care system.
In a large city like Sydney arrcsts fsr drunksn- ness can total several hundred each night and policy decisions will be required as to how many of such persons should be taken to a detoxification centre.
National Archives of Australia For drug dependent persons other than alcoholics, medically withdrawal, ''the bad trip'' and intercurrent illness.
The addicted person frequently finds it difficult to gain admission to both general and psychiatric hospitals once the fact of his addiction is revealed and he is in fear of seeking treatment with its concomitant risk of legal sanctions being invoked.
Arrangements are required whereby immediate admission is available for drug dependent persons without prejudice, without rejection as a recurrent phenomenon and without fear of legal sanctions being imposed.
Such centres could be established in a variety of settings amongst which could be an independent drug treatment centre, a general hospital or a mental hospital.
The essential feature is that the unit be able to establish an admission policy independent of any larger parent organisation.
The institutional atmosphere of such centres should be minimised.
2.4 Treatment Centre The failure to control addiction in the United States of America is eloquent testimony to the inability of conventional medical and psychiatric practice to cope with this problem.
The common error has been to regard drug dependence as a single problem for which a single treatment can be found.
undoubtedly some drug dependent persons are managed well by conventional techniques but a far greater number are not.
The legalistic approach which punishes and confines the addict on the basis of a naive negative conditioning theory reinforced by abstinence has been equally ineffective.
Such policies are often given expression in the phrase, ''locked away for his own good''.
The U.S. Public Health Service Institution in Lexington, Kentucky, will attest to the failure of this system where even within the institution a drug-free environment could not be guaranteed.
For these reasons an eclectic approach is advocated.
This eclecticism must, however, go well beyond the traditional boundaries of psychiatry.
The elements of a comprehensive eyetem are set out.
The established mental health care system is able to absorb a number of patients assessed as requiring conventional treatment.
No separate facility is advocated but placements should be facilitated by close communication between the relevant agencies.
National Archives of Australia Certain addicted persons appear to do well in the therapeutic community style unit, e.g.
Very difficult problems surround the management of such units within the mental hospital system and much therapeutic energy can be diverted into solving problems of relationship with the parent system.
It is also difficult if not impossible, to overcome the problem of attitude inherent in staff, particularly nurses who are identified with conventional treatment systems.
For these reasons we advocate the establishment of such units under psychiatric direction but outside the mental hospital and general hospital systems.
We also advocate staffing by applicants specially selected and trained.
We recognise the difficulties inherent in administering small separate units, but consider the therapeutic advantages outweigh the administrative disadvantages.
In addition to the psychiatrically orientated therapeutic community referred to above (2.4.2) there has been a measure of observed success with self-governing therapeutic communities with the emphasis on individual and group responsibility House).
Such groups use a variety of grout techniques usually nf dramatic confronting kind.
Psychiatrists generally are concerned at the lack of controls inherent in such systems but in the absence of evidence that these systems do any harm and in the present failure situation some experimentation in this direction is advocated.
These systems may be established best by voluntary organisations, with government support where In all forms of therapeutic community treatment the administering authorities must be prepared to accept criticism and ridicule.
It is not possible to run such units without some addicted people taking drugs, some depressed people committing suicide and some promiscuous people behaving and rrimarv Contact Centres A typical programmes quite different from conventional services and perhaps regarded as alien to present adult community value judgments need to be considered.
Service personnel are required to at least accept the life style of the clientele and avoid moralising, and insisting on conformity to middle-class values in relation to work, sexual propriety, religious concepts and the like.
National Archives of Australia Strategically placed first line facilities in areas such as the city centre where dropouts can gather, where empathic professional help is available to discuss problems and where crises can at least be examined are needed.
Voluntary organisations with professional consultation and employing some minimal professional staff would appear most suited to manage such centres.
Mental Health Consultation CQDUltY Organisation and Services to IOutr The provision of health education programmes is not commented on as this has already been the subject of full discussion and action arising out of the Commonwealth grant for this purpose.
It has become apparent however, that it is difficult and undesirable to separate health education entirely from service programmes to youth and community organisations.
Greater flexibility and additional finance is required to allow assistance to be offered directly by the State and by way of subsidy to voluntary organisations in the field of Community Organisation and Youth Counselling (i) Establish Youth Counselling Centres These centres are designed to provide a non medically oriented advisory and counselling service for young people and their parents.
Thus far the programmes have been restricted to promoting part-time centres staffed by counsellors employed by the State Association for Mental Health on a sessional basis.
As a further step the establishment of permanent centres is envisaged, staffed on a fulltime basis, providing ''drop-in'' services as well as the present appointment system.
The creation of positions is proposed for ''Youth Programme Organisers'' whose task would be by way of commnity organisation to promote programmes at the local community level 'designed to offer young people effective alternatives to involvement in the various deviant subcultures including drug abuse''.
The particular need in this area is for funds on an annual basis to meet the salaries of counsellors and programme staff, to provide training and for relatively small capital grants to establish centres, and to assist voluntary organisations secure suitable premises.
National Archives of Australia fDLILITATION AND follows UP SERVICES 3.1 In a large proportion of the drug dependent population a subculture exists in which the style of life revolves around organising supplies and use of a particular drug.
This style of life has become so ingrained and conditioned that energetic measures and the exhibition of options will have to be made in order to attract the addict into a more productive way of life.
Fundamental alterations in a patient's style of operation will be required if he is to avoid relapse.
Such service as: will have to receive attention if success is to be achieved.
wherever possible existing facilities should be utilised.
3.2 It is possible that the traditional concern with intra- psychic pathology has led to a neglect of the cognitive aspects of personality growth and the value of ''success'' as a factor in promoting a 'healthy'' adaptation to life.
Certainly rehabilitation cannot hope to succeed if it does not offer the client an improvement on his previous condition.
This improvement may have to be more than a restoration of the pre-drug level of existence which the client found to be intolerable.
Put another way, what is needed is a better job, more money, different friends and better prospects for the future then the pre-drug state offered.
In Denmark and in Iowa (U.S.A.) Alcoholism and Addiction Counsellors have been appointed.
Counsellors could be appointed here on a regional basis and could be encompassed within whatever system of service was adopted locally.
Counsellors could be attached to each sub- rerional mental health team.
he duties of counsellors would be to provide counselling and case work services to alcohol and drug dependent persons and their families.
With respect to such persons and their families: To provide advice and counselling To assist them to obtain treatment and rehabilitation from existing agencies.
National Archives of Australia To assist them to utilise existing legislation to secure treatment and welfare assistance.
To assist them to secure employment and To make domiciliary and community visits as To provide consultation to voluntary agencies and state departments with respect to services to such persons.
To provide a link between such agencies, family doctors and established psychiatric services.
recruitment of counsellors would be broadly based (similar to Social Health Wisitors in the Australian Capital Territory) and applicants with a history of alcoholism or drug dependence would be considered, subject to suitable safe-guards.
Additional finance would be required for this programme.
wrote to the Commcnwealth Department of Health concerning; the feasibility of using a computer model to determine the dynamic advised that he had been in touch with Professor Jay W, Forester of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been engaged in an analysis of various social systems using computer models.
A copy of the relevant extract from Dr. Gun's letter is attached.
You will note that Dr. Gun requested that the possible use of systems analysis be considered b the National Standing Control Committee in relation to the drug problem.
Dr. Gun was advised that officer of the Comnonsstlth Department of Health would contact Professor Forester with a vis; to obtaining more information.
The Department has determined through the Oificos of also through the U.S. Presidet's Special Advisory Office of Seience and Technology that Professor Norrester's work is ccncerned with the effect of many factors son human society and the world environment.
His computer models are directed towards predicticas of the fate of the world and use such inputs as agricultural growth, etc. Drug abuse appears to be only a small part of an in- put of social factors.
In the opinion of the Department of Health, it may he the available basic data.
a National Archives of Australia i ARON CITY OF SHOPS At Minister for Health, Thank you for your letter of 3th december, 1977, enclosing an outline of the action which has been taken in respect of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and rug Abuse.
I wish to take up two matters with you, the first being an enquiry.
I seek information concerning the reason behind the introduction of the recent amendments to the Customs Act relating to drugs offences.
In view of the fact that drug offenders can be dealt with under existing taste Legislation, it is not clear wily the amendments to the Customs ict were introduced.
I would be crateful, therefore, if you would indicate why the move to amend the Customs Act wus initiated and ir what way the Government regarded existing State legislation as inadequate.
mould you please also tell me wether the legislation was pursuant to any recommendation of the enate Select Committee? he other matter is, I believe, one of overt riding importance in the consideration of all social or political action directed against the drug problem.
In the public and private debates which take place on this problem, most people are inclined to disregard those arguments which do not accord with their own prejudices.
Even when a completely uncommitted approach is taken to the problem, it is very difficult to arrive at a correct conclusion as to the relative importance of the various causes of the increasing drug problem and the effects of the various measures proposed to overcome it.
I shall take a simple example.
le recent amendments to the Customs Act have been criticised as emphasising the punitive approach at the expense of other measures, such as education.
On the other hand those who have criticized the Covern- meant's approach have tended to overlook the fact that criminal sanctions do have some deterrent effect.
It appears to me therefore, that we will never find a solution to the drug problem whilst we rely on the seat of our pants in determining what action we will take.
For this reason, I have been exercising my mind for some time on the feasibility of using a computer model to determine the dynamic effects, upon each other, of various anti-drug measures.
I have been in touch personally enology.
Professor Forester has been engaged in an analysis by use of computer models of various social systems, and has sent me a systems simulation of ''Narcotics and the Community'', a study undertaken at the Albert einstein College of Medicine.
The information used in con structuring the model has been gathered from a variety of sources, National Archives of Australia includint published literature, an area study of an urban community research scientists, teachers, parole officers and other informant I am not suggesting that this model is a panacea but it has, I believe, important implications.
The study indicates that intuition on the part of governments and other policy and opinion-makers about the probable consequences of proposed policies frequently roves to be less reliable than the meticulous arithmetical approach of a computer model.
The following quotation from the study is of ''The behavior of any system in which as many as a hundred or more variables are known to be relevant and believed to be related to one another in various nonlinear fashions is complex far beyond the capacity of intuition and, incidentally, even further beyond the capacity of formal mathematical analysis.
Simulation is one of the most effective means available for supplementing and correcting human intuition.
n computer simulation or model of the variety described here is a powerful conceptual device that can increase the role of reason at the expense of rhetoric in the determination of policy.
model is not, as sometimes supposed, a perfectly accurate representation of reality that can be trusted to make better decisions than people.
It is a flexible tool that forces the people who use it to think hard and to confront one another, their common problems and themselves directly and factually.''
Naturally, the collection of data uan other measures biens undertaken by the National Standing Committee on Drurs of Dependence must continue and be given every encouragement.
However, I believe, that an adequate approach to the drug problem is impossible without the implementation of a systems analysis.
I ask, therefore, that this matter be referred by you to the National Standing Committee on Drugs of Dependence and that any recommendation for setting up such a program by the Committee, will be given favourable consideration by the Government.
I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter with the National Standing Committee.
I am sending a copy of this letter to the Minister for Customs 8 Excise.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM STATES .
New South Wales Methadone maintenance has been undertaken in a number of patients in this State on a trial basis.
It has been found necessary to maintain strict control over the use of methadone in these programmes and this has been exercised by the Director-General of Public Health through his powers under Section 28 of the Poisons Act 1966.
It is a condition of the issue of an authority to prescribe methadone that each patient presents daily to take his dose under supervision.
Where the patient wishes to travel anywhere that is not within reach of one of the established units, a supply of up to three days requirements at one time may be authorised.
When a patient wishes to go interstate or overseas, prior arrangements must be made for supervision of his continued treatment.
This State considers that it is necessary that methadone maintenance patient programmes should be closely supervised psychiatrically and that their medication should be dispensed daily and taken only under direct supervision.
In accordance with the drug programme in Queensland at the present time, patients would be required to present at a Public Hospital for their methadone. .
South Australia Methadone is a narcotic drug in this State and may only be supplied by or on the prescription of a medical practitioner registered in South Australia In this State the matter is currently under consideration.
In commenting on a Departmental inquiry concerning persons entering the country while on methadone maintenance programmes, the Western Australian Department of Public Health indicated that there was little or nc heroin addiction in the State.
They do not think it justifiable to jeopardise this state of affairs by giving permission to known addicts to enter the country while their rehabilitation is still in the precarious area of methadone substitution National Archives of Australia The current policy is to treat each case on its merits.
It is not considered that methadone maintenance in high dosage on an indefinite basis is a desirably mthcd of treatment at this stage.
The matter is being kept under review and once facilities have been established persons on a methadone maintenance regime will be treated on a conservative basis.
Natonal Archives of Australia Agenda Item 8 Statistics of Psychotropic Substances Under the Psychotropic Substances Convention Australia is required to furnish to the International Narcotics Control Board the following statistics relating to psychotropic substances for each calendar Schedule Substances (a) Quantity manufactured Schedule II Substances (a) Quantity manufactured (b) Quantity utilised for manufacture of exempt preparations (c) Quantity utilised for manufacture of non-psychotropic substances Schedule III Substances (a) Quantity manufactured (b) Quantity utilised for manufacture of exempt preparations (c) Quantity utilised for manufacture of non-psychotropic substances Schedule IV Substances (a) Quantity manufactured (b) Quantity utilised in manufacture of non- psychotropic substances Figures for stocks as at 3 December each year to be supplied by State Health authorities in respect of Schedule I and Schedule II substances Manufacturers of psychotropic substances will be licensed by the Health authorities.
These authorities will be responsible for ensuring adequate controls and providing details of statistics of manufacture.
Note that the term manufacture also includes the making of preparations other than those made on prescription in pharmacies.
The preparations concerned would be only those not covered by the procedure set out in the following section.
National Archives of Australia quantity utilised for Manufacture of Exemnt Preparations Article 3 of the Convention provides for the partial exemption of preparations if they are compounded in such a way that they: (a) present no or a negligible risk of abuse; (b) are not readily recoverable in quantities liable to abuse; so that the preparation does not give rise to a public health and social Health authorities will be required to provide statistics of the qquantity of substances used in the manufacture of these preparations, but it will not be necessary to provide statistics of quantities of these preparations manufactured.
In order to avail themselves of the exemption provisions, parties will be required to forward to the Secretary-General the name and composition of each preparation which they propose to exempt.
It is obviously in the interest of a government to prepare the list of exemptions before becoming a party to the Convention so that they can be furnished to the Secretary-General at the time of ratification.
The preparation of such a list of exemptions would perhaps be most appropriately undertaken by the Poisons Schedule Advisory Committee of quantity Used in the Manufacture of non-psvchotropic substances Article 4 provides for the use of psychotropic substances in industry for the manufacture of non-psychotropic substances or products.
Such psychotropic substances are still subject to control whilst they are in a condition where they could be abused or recovered.
State Health authorities will be required to supply statistics of quantities of psychotropic substances so utilised.
Imports and Erports These figures will be provided by Customs.
The International Narcotics Control Board has already requested the above statistics for the year 1971.
It is proposed to provide those import and export statistics which are available and advise that other in- formation is not available for the year 1971.
It is hoped that State Health authorities will be in a position to provide all the above statistics in respect of the current year.
At the present time it is considered that the wording of the Psychotropic Substances Convention is such that it does not include the salts and esters of the substances listed in the four schedules.
This aspect is currently being followed up with the United Nations.
In the meantime, it is considered that Australia should exercise similar controls over the salts and ethers as it does over the substances NationaltAyeeles of Australia i Specialist Training for Drug Investigators At its meeting on 3.4.70 the Committee agreed that there was merit in the proposal to have a centralised training course for all drug investigators.
Subsequently training courses were conducted by Customs and the Commonwealth Police.
To avoid overlap it was suggested that future courses be conducted using the facilities of the Commonwealth Police.
While recognising the value of the courses which have been conducted by the Commonwealth Police these must of necessity be in the nature of generalised training.
It is felt that there is also a need for specialist training by each law enforcement authority tailored to meet the needs of its organisation and the levels of knowledge and efficiency within the Two such courses have in fact been held, one by Customs and one by Tasmanian police.
Two members of Victorian Drug Squad attended the Customs course and Customs provided a lecturer for the course in Tasmania.
The matter is raised for discussion so that the respective roles of the two types of courses can be spelled out and to consider the extent to which places on the specialised training courses should be offered to fellow law enforcement agencies in Australia and overseas.
National Archives of Australia As agreed at the last meeting of the Committee on 9 February 1972, the report of the Working Party on Transport Security has been referred to the National Therapeutic Goods Committee for examination in conjunction with the Code of Good Manufacturing Practices.
The report will be considered by the August meeting of the National Therapeutic Goode Committee.
At the last meeting of the Committee on 9 February t972, it was agreed that the States should submit reports on the monitoring system and that these reports should be reviewed by a Working Party comprising representatives from the Commonwealth Department of ht of Customs and excise and the Health Department in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.
The Working Party met on 18 April 1972.
Obgervers were invited from the Departments of Health Queensland, South Australia, After considering the reports on the system and other points raised during the meeting, the Working Party agreed to the following recommendation: ''The meeting unanimously supported the monitoring system; agreed with the modifications introduced; supported efforts to simplify procedures; recognised the system as a recording system and its value in preventing illicit dispersion of narcotise and requested that the system should continue.''
The report of the Working Party meeting is attached togsther with copies of the reports submitted by the states.
The following items in the Worling Party report have been listed for discussion as separate agenda items: .Controls over Imported Hallucinogens sampling of Narcotics supply of Narcotics to Ships National Archives ofAueteNe Department of Customs dt Excise The following informatton is received by the Department of Customs c Excise: details of imports and exports return of stocks held by reporting authorities as at destructions and losses of drugs by reporting authorities .retumn of sales by reporting authorities to Commonwealth The above information is required to enable the department to complete statistical returns, etc, for furnishing to tne United dilations in accordance with the requirements of the Single convention.
It is anticipated that in the future details of narcotics drugs used in the manufacture of uncontrolled preparations will uso be available through the monitoring system.

In regard to ''ad hoc'' investigations it enables the officer to expect complete vreification of all outward movements against known ii is understood that exception reporting in respect of Office as it will enable the early detection of uruisel movegrts of reification of reporting authority to reporting authority transactions is alto regarded as desirable an instance of incorrect Acting Director, A C.T. Health Services 13 YoUNG STREET A es N The Director General of Hei, Department of Health, I refer to your letter of 23rd February, 1972, regarding the resolution of the National Standing Control Committee at its Ninth Meeting that the States should report on the monitoring system, as a prelude to a review of the system by the Working Party on Monitoring of Licit Transactions in Drugs of Dependence.
Manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drugs of addiction in New South Wales have now been submitting weekly returns of transactions involving such drug for oust over 18 months.
Some of the original aims of the system have yet to be achieved, and to this extent we have been rather disappointed in its value so far.
However, there have been some ancillary benefits beyond the origins list of objectives that have compensated to some extent for the absence of some expected As originally conceived, the monitoring system was intended to assist administrative and enforcement authorities in of drugs of addiction within Australia, and to assist in supervising the licit use of drugs of addiction.
To do this efficiently, the system must be able to process information and deliver it in a form that is of use to administrative and enforcement authorities.
To date, the bulk of the information forwarded to this Department has been either of little practical value or has been in a form that must In respect of the data that has been provided to date, the regular print-outs of transactions classified by Reporting Authority are, as far as I can ssa, nly a uplicaticu of the input material.
Tht only section of that inforaticn that has really been useful at any stage has been the table hooded returns from reporting Authorities easier to refer to than the print-outs, as they are more easily accessible, more up-to-date, and less bulky.
It is requested that you discontinue forwarding to this Department routine print-outs of transactions classified by Reporting Authority. of transactions classified by non-reporting authority.
These printouts have been provided on request for thcse non-reporting authorities specified in the request, and provide information that is almost impossible to obtain by other means.
Although they have suffered from the disadvantage value in both routine inspection work and in special investigations.
They have been used in the course of routine inspections to verify that drug registers are being faithfully maintained, as inspecting pharmacists can quickly compare a print-out with the receipts of drugs recorded in the register.
They have been useful in both routine inspections and in special investigations to help trace the movement of drugs and the pattern of drug usage in particular areas.
Such investigations have involved such matters as tracing the movements of addicts and detecting doctors who are prescribing large quantities of drugs of addiction without the authority of the Director-General of Public Health.
It is understood that the computer program has been further developed to provide print-outs by non-reporting authority in decoded form.
This will greatly assist inspection pharmacists by enabling them to use their time more effectively as they will no longer have to spend time manually decoding the information.
Another development of the computer program will, l understand, enable you to provide on s regular basis decoded reports of all non reporting authorities purchasing more than a specified quantity of any drug of addiction during a four week period.
There reports will, I am told, contain details of all purchases of such drugs, and thus enable administrative and enforcement personnel to concentrate on those non-reporting authorities purchasing abnormally large quantities of drugs of addiction.
I believe that the introduction of an effective exception reporting system may provide the most significant benefit from the monitoring system.
It should provide a means of recognising more quickly movements of addicts and unusual or undesirable prescribing patterns.
Eception reporting should also help to pinpcint any avenues of drug diversion that may at present be escaping detection.
One task that appears to have hen continued unnecessarily has been the physical check of stock levels at the beginning of each year.
It is understood that the computer program has omen designed to provide information on stuck held by all reporting authorities at the end of each reporting period.
provided the computed stock.
level has been verified by a stock check at some time during the year, it should be sufficient for international reporting and estimate purposes to use computed stock levels at the end of each year.
There may be a few reporting authorities whose reports have been found to be not sufficiently reliable for this purpose, but there shuld be few of these, and those that are unreliable might well be prevented from handling rugs of addiction in due course.
Nationaf Archives of Australia Among the unexpected benefits of the monitoring system has been the revelaticn that present methods of recording the manufacture of drug preparations are often unsatisfactory.
A method of recording manufacturing transactions which overcomes the disappearance of the drugs from the drug records during the period of manufacture has been devised by officers of this Department, and is being discussed with a number of manufacturers of drug preparations in New South Wales.
When comments have been received and the procedure tested by some of the manufacturers, I would welcome consideration of it by the Wiorking Party, with a view to its possible adoption throughout Australia.
In summary, I would advise that the print-out of transactions by Reporting Authority is of little or no value, and it is requested that distribution of this print-out to New South Wales be discontinued.
The print-outs on non-reporting authorities are of value, and this value will be considerably enhanced when print-outs are provided in decoded form.
The development of exception reporting is awaited with interest, as it is believed that this may be the most useful aspect of the system from our point of view.
However, I am disappointed that the system has not so far been developed to provide decoded reports on non-reporting authorities and exception reports.
National Archives of Australia at necessity of serrate licences to handle rus of diction and the use of qualified staff, the confuter system hs acted as a deterrent to the mmshrooming. of numerous narcotic outlets.
To sum un, I belleve this syeten las served nd ill serve a very useful purpese in the control of iris of addiction an the furighiny of necessary statistics for the completion of reports, eg, Australia's Annual Report to United I was of the opinion that the scheme would need at least twelve months to ''Bed-domn' and it would seem e complete waste of time, money and effort if the scheme ere to he abandoned just as it is, I relive, about to produce information which will greatly assist our drug control programmes.
I believe that the computer personnel of the Commonealth Health Department should be highly commended for the manner in ihich they have devised programmes for the receipt and compilatin of the material being supplied to them.
as COPy if The Dlrector-General of Health, Dear Sir, I refer to the Drugs of Dependence Monitoring System and advise that, to the end of 1971, this Department has used the system for the following purposes: (a) Routine alit procedures based on information derived from Tables l and 4 .
Table l has been summarised upon receipt and all purchases in excess of predetermined levels have been investigated.
Such investigations resulted in the conviction of cone pharmaceutical chemist for the sale and self-administration of Drinamyl without authority.
It is anticipated the promulgation of the exception reporting print out will obviate the summarising now effected in this office.
Table 4 has been invaluable in presenting information not otherwise readily available.
b) Speclal investigations not prompted by computer out put - although no prosecution, in this context, has been based upon information presented by the computer, such information has been used in resolving situations wherein clear cut offences were not apparent.
It is recognised that this Department is only now beginning to utlllse the full potentlal of the system by way of ''Scans'' and the use of this service is expected to increase.
Yours faithfully, Secretary, Director- General of Hsalth and Medical Services.
The System ra len in cperat'rt in this State for approximately i 2. Apart from some initial ''teething troubles'' it is considered in the main, the System has achieved a effective control over the licit usages of drugs of dependence.

as evidence in the closed liaison and oo operation existing 6.
Management of some of our reporting authorities have advised us that the existing System in this Coutry compares more than favourably with any tt operations in the Uited States of America and Europe.
This Section greatly appreciates the courtesy, advice and the considerable volume of special information it has been supplied with from the staff of the Drugs of Dependence Section, Canberra over the txo years of operation of the Monitoring System.
NatonarArchives of Australia The monitoring system is based upon weekly reports of all movements of drugs of dependence t and from wholesalers and manufacturers.
Reports are monitored also of all supplies made and hospitals supplied by manufacturers or wholesalers.
All manufacturers and whglecelers sre specially licensed to deal in drs of addiction, all pharmacists are licensed to deal in poisons enterally, private hospitals are specifically licensed to handle drugs of addiction, and medical department records list all Government Hospitals.
This system is based on weekly reports of movements to and from manufacturers end wholesalers in conjunction with automatic back-reporting by computer which analyses movements and provides the only valid record, incapable of falsification, of licit distribution of drugs of dependence.
This system has proved invaluable, and constitutes a major con attribution to the control of drugs of dependence.
This memoran- dum describes the problems encountered in its adoption, the situation in W.A. prior to this new system, the present situation, and touches on its logical extension.
It should be borne in mind that the system is economical in staff costs.
Few problems have arisen since the scheme commenced.
Wholesalers in general have found few problems once the mechanics have been grasped.
The few problems arising were human errors, solely results of misunderstanding the work involved.
Failure to report drugs of addiction by wholesalers is the most common fault.
Inward movements are the greater source of error: items returned for credit from pharmacies are the chief source of this error, (wholesalers enter credit returns in finance accounting elders but occasionally fail tos report these movements in weekly reports).
We have found these problems overcome as each report- ing authority gradually realises the benefits from the scheme in its own overall business administration.
Initially some reports were duplicated in ''cut louts'' from Canberra to this office, but this has now been rectified.
An occasional fault still occurring is non reporting by the computer, or delayed appearing in a later cut out.
lWe have noted progress in rectification of this.
(This caused balances of some drugs to be incorrect, and takes time to rectify).
The initial nuisance value was worthwhile in bringing ourselves and wholesalers p tc National Archives of Australia system is fairly satisfactory, reasonably simple and successful to use, and has the unique property of supplying accuracy Prior to adoption of the system, inspections were of an un- satisfactory nature.
Records examined were compiled by self- interested people.
Inspections were of no real value other than ''showing the flag''.
Dealings were impossible to police with accuracy; reliance was mainly on spot checks.
When errors were detected, which was frequent enough, there was little open to do but accept any plausible story.
Reliance of pre monitoring inspection procedure was largely on untrained or partially trained personnel who, with the best of goodwill, accumulated experience with efflurion of time and reached a position of limited understanding.
Suspicions and knowledge of leaks to other States gave rise to an atmosphere of concern.
The prior position was unsatisfactory and caused misgivings in the light of a drug problem which, it was felt, was due to be imported into Australia, Two unqualified inspectors are able to carry out inspecticns with accuracy since the adoption of the monitoring system.
These inspectors are also used to investigate other problems in connection with poisons and pesticides as these occur and when these are within their capabilities).
Such economic use of unqualified personnel as this can give rise to perfect in- sections as the checking of suppliers' stocks and records is on the basis of our own records or movements.
Inspections are now cumplete under each category at intervals appropriate to the nature of the dealer's poisons, (numbers and Wholesalers have tightened up procedures and are glad to have done so.
Wholesalers' failures in appointing suitable staff have come to the attention of wholesalers automatically without involving personal elements.
Since adoption of the monitoring system there have not been any reports of leakage of drugs of dependence via any inform- National Archives of Austalia It appears that work involved in the system still reduces with evoluticnary use whilst giving the same result - abolition of leakages from licit sources with a certainty of detection.
It is further felt that should criminal organisatins produce methods likely to defat present scheme methods, then modifica- tin of reporting and reporting back procedures would defeat such attempts without retention of costs.
The scheme has been the key to prevention of dispersion of licit materials to illicit areas.
The full economic advantage of the scheme is not capable of estimation, particularly in the light of costs of detecting, convicting and imprisoning illicit dealers and the high cost of treating addicts.
It is submitted that further effort should be made to maintain the scheme co-incidental with continual examination for im- approvement in information provided to State authorities.
report: ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AND UTILISATION CF SYSTEM OF As far as Tasmania is concerned the scheme of monitoring licit transactions has clnsed lopholes which previously existed in regard to interstate transactions by enabling diversions from the licit trade to be more readily detected.
In edition, it has now become complementary to the scheme operating in Tasmania whereby all Pharmacists, including Hospital Pharmacists, submit to the Department a monthly return of all acquisitions and disposals of dangerous drugs which includes the name of the patient and the prescribing doctor alon with the name of the drug for each dispensed It is now possible for a cross checking of the computer printout and a Pharmacist's records to be made in the office so lat any discrepancy can be detected before a Eharmacy is Since its inception the monitoring system has enabled a number of breaches of Regulations to be detected which ln adedition, the system has provided a source of sttis;ticel infirmation on drug usage which is currently nci utliiscd in detailed investigation of prescribing patterns for dangerous drugs in Tasmania.
The introduction of exception reporting will be of assistance in highlighting transactions which probably need most urgent attention.
In summary, it is considered that the system, from this state's point of view, is a very useful operation and the co-operuation and assistance afforded by the officers of tl:e iruyw of Dependence Section is greatly appreciated.
National Archives of Australia RESEARCH BACKGROUND In the second report to Ministers, 24 April, 7970 the N.S.C.C. made the folloming recommendation (a) that the Commonwealth make available prohibited drugs for approved research programmes; (b) that the Commonwealth Government consider making a special allocation of funds to the National Standing Control Committee in order that research into all aspects ofthe problem of drug abuse be fostered; (c) that funds so allocated should be earmarked for this purpose and that projects put forward should be evaluated through the mechanism of the Medical Research Advisory Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council.
Grants for 1977 and 1972 have been made by the National Health and Medical Research Council for the following new research projects: monitoring trends in drug use and abuse.
COMMENTS It was considered that, in view of the allocation of 8500,O00 by the Commonwealth for drug education, an approach for additional Commonwealth funds for research would be It has been recommended that this aspect should be taken up further at the next meeting of Ministers.
One aspect of research which needs further consideration with a view to its submission to Ministers, is the question of the use of human beings for research on the effects of cannabis.
This question has already been raised by Dr. Chesher.
He recently submitted a report to the Minister for Customs and Excise on projects undertaken to date.
He also se out proposed future projects, some of which involve the use of human volunteers.
National Archives of Australia At the meeting of the Working Party to review the monitoring system, it was resolved that the Commonwealth Department of Health ghoul extract figures from the monitoring system on the volume of narcotic sampling and that the figures should be presented to the Committee for consideration.

States cculd also include comments on the progress they hoped to achieve in 1972/73 and their need for support.
National Archives of Australia 3.3 The subcommittee noted that no voluntary organisation should be supported by the National Standing Control Committee without the approval of the relevant State Health Minister and that voluntary organisations shouldd be encouraged to make any approach for financial assistance through the appropriate State Health authorities rather than direct to 3.4 The Chairman reported that he had received submissions for financial assistance from the Buoyancy Foundation and from the Alcoholism Foundation of victoria.
He had submitted their proposals to the State health Department in Victoria.
3.5 Dr. Krister asked if the same percentage of salaries in State Programmes would be supported in 1972/75 as had been agreed for the 1971/72 financial year (68.34) or would there be any increase.
3.6 The subcommittee was informed that this percentage had been agreed to for 197172 and nothing had been said about salaries for 1972/75 apart from the likelihood of a diminish- ing contribution by the Commonwealth in this area.
.1 Handbook on Use and Abuse of Drugs The subcommittee noted that twenty thousand copies of the Handbook had been printed and distributed to N.S.W., Victoria Tasmania and the Commonwealth Department of Health.
Members noted that the ninth issue of the Bulletin had been distributed.
Mailing lists compiled by the Secretariat were circulated at the Meeting for the information of State members who were requested to update these and return as soon as possible to the .2.2 Dr. Clements drew the attention of members to the comments by journalists at the Seminar on 26 and 27 February that there was no local content in the ninth issue.
He suggested it was up to the States to see that the Secretariat was provided with any local material which would make useful and interesting reading in the Bulletin.
Dr. Milner indicated that local news was fairly readily available and this could be the reason Whv more overseas material featured in the Bulletin.
It was suggested that overseas material could be annotated and some guidanco given towards local application.
Dr, Milner pointed out that this would be very difficult.
4.3.1 States were asked to comment on the progress achieved in distributing this pamphlet to schools.
Dr. Fuller reported that South Australia had distributed copies received but 100 more copies were needed to complete the issue to all secondary schols.
Since the Christmas vacation, there had been a mall feedback.
Seven Headmasters had contacted the S.A. Health Department.
Other States reported that their distribution was completed or would be completed in March.
Hembers noted that a second printing of the discussion kit had been completed and that States had received their respective orders.
.5 State requirements of publications .5.
States were asked to consider their requirements concerning Commonwealth publications for the year .5.2 Attention was drawn to the frequent small orders submitted by some States and the difficulties which arise if this is continued.
Dr. Krister indicated that the States also had difficulties in planning ahead as, at times, demand changed for the various publications.

Mr. Healey suggested that a couple of errors in English should be corrected in the draft documents.
Mr. Ying considered that the documents were inclined to be a little apologetic and not sufficiently hard- 5.5.4
The Chairman indicated that he considered the preamble in the one document was unnecessarily long.
In the document containing the extracts, the passage ccn- cering brain damage findings should be deleted as the study from which it had been taken had received adverse criticism.

They had agreed that the document with the extracts from research findings was the more convincing.
5.5.7 Dr. Milner advised that he considered there was a hazard in quoting to the lay person from research 5.5.8
Mr. Healey indicated that he considered the pamphlets would be of doubtful use as far as the habitual drug user was concerned and that he did not think it would deter the intending user.
However, it would reinforce those committed against the use of marihuana.
Dr. Clements indicated that he would not worry about quoting extracts from research findings to lay people.
The journalists at the seminar had advised that ''names were news.

Shorts to publicise ''The Choice'' 7..4.1 Dr. Clements reported that the it had taken cuts from the ilm and these were ready now to make into a short film.
The question which had to be decided was whether the States really wanted these shorts and how they could oe used.
Members agreed that their decision had been a rather hasty one following the viewing of the shorts publicising, ''Where Are We 7.t.4.3
It was pointed out that 'Where Are We Heading?'' was designed for a wider audience, for adults in the community, and therefore the screening of trailers had a role.
''The Choice'' was designed for restricted audiences namely captive school children.
7.t.4.4 Nembers discussed whether the shorts had a place in the programme and the possible audiences to whom the shorts could be directed.
They agreed that their original decision may have been a mistake.
Mr. Holliday said that Queensland would strongly object to any further promotion of its 7.1 4.5 The Chairman indicated that he would prefer to see the money go to State programmes rather than have it spent on trailers which could not be used.

Mr. Carr suggested that the young people could be.

B.2.5 Dr. Clements advised that he believed direct correspondence with the young people nominated by the States should be undertaken as early as possible.
The young people should be supplied with: (a) information concerning the running cf seminars material was available from the U.N.); (b) material concerning areas of interest indicated during the pre-seninar phase.
It was considered important that children gain the right kind of experience in the pre-seminar phase in the various States.
8.2.5 Dr. Krister pointed out that M.S.W. was not conducting the pre-seminar stage until the end of April and the nominees could not be approached until this time.
The Sub-Comrittee agreed that one observer from each State should accompany the young people and that preference should be given to subcommittee members.
8.2.7 The subcommittee stressed that it was important to arrange for adequate media coverage for the State seminars and also for the National seminar.

Dr. Fuller reputed on the seminar and indicated that he had made good personal contacts with various journalists.
Certain basic differences between the educators and the journalists had been noted and it did not seem that these differences would ever be resolved.
He considered that the Media's role in any programme must of necessity be a limited one but they did definitely have a role.
Dr. Clements reported that a working party had been established comprising representatives of the media and drug education representatives.
Media represents actives had been nominated and drug education represent actives would be nominated by the National tangling Control Committee.
The Working Party would lay dow guidelines whereby information could be disseminated in each State.

The present interest, which La Trobe University had indicated, might be stifled.

Dr. 'alshe asked if one film for each type of audience was sufficient.
Dr. Clements informed members that the Commonwealth Film Unit could be making a Petty film entitled, ''Identity'' in about twelve months.
This could possibly be added to the film collection.

O. Members noted that Dr. Irwin was currently undertaling a review of the literature and investigating the present educational situation in the A.C.T., Sydney and Melbourne.
The Chairman pointed out that the Tasmanian Miuseum project should be considered in conjunction with proposals from the other States.
All States had submitted proposals for further 11.2 Fr.
Fuller indicated that he had received the impression that State proposals were to have been concerned with special projects only and that ''special project'' had a certain significance.
He understood that the proposals were not to be for the expansion of existing programmes nor for ordinary items of expenditure.
The money which was available was to be distributed to the States to enable new projects to be started earlier.
He asked for an interpret- some specially meaningful projects that the States might have in mind.
It seemed possible that some of the States may have been misled.
Skene, the observer from the Department of Customs and excise indicated that he had the draft minutes of the Tational standing Control Committee meeting available and read the relevant section from the draft report: ''The Chairman referred back to the money likely to be unspent from that set aside for social purposes.
He indicated that the amount would he too small to distribte betreen the States and that it would be preferable if it were used National Archives of Australia t1.5 Dr. Walshe recalled that the Chairman of the National tannin Control Committee had been asked about a proposal that this was not a new project and that there had been an existing need for some time.
The Chairman of the rational Standing Control Committee had agreed that this project cculd be considered with proposals for assistance from tale Special Fund.
1.6 Members discussed how they could define ''special projects'' and agreed there was no simple formula.
Some direction was required if they were to distinguish between special projects and others.
If all proposals were not considered some States would be at a disadvantage as they had not understood that only certain projects would be eligible for assistance.
11.T The subcommittee agreed that they should consider all the proposals and that State members should indicate priorities so that these could be referred to the National Standing Control Committee.
14.8 Members agreed that a great deal of objectivity would be required if they were to suggest that their own proposals were not to be recommended.
11.9 Mr, watts advised that Victoria was grateful to the Chairman of the National Stanin Control Committee for suggesting that the proposed transfer of ''3, 000 should be considered as a request for an additional 3,000 from the balance of money set aside for special purposes.
He indicated that Victoria only desired to transfer this money from one project to another as outlined in the letter of 10 February.
cering a further :3 000 should be withdrawn and that the transfer of this amount should be recommended.
11.1 The Chairman indicated that he had received advice that f10, 00o had been set aside out of the Commonwealth money provided State agreement was obtained for grants to voluntary community bodies.
He had arranged a meeting between Foundation of Victoria and representatives of the Vvictorian Health Department and the victorian Mental Health authority.
Mr. Rogan had indicated that he would give a reply concerning the two organisations prior to the subcommittee's meeting.

11.13 Members indicated that they were rather confused.
Dr. riser asked if the $OO0O which had been set aside for voluntary organisations was to come out of the 950OOO for drug education activities.
Members requested that they be informed exactly how much remained in this Special Fund and did this mean that $1,500 would remain for distribution to the States.
The Sub Committee was advised that as reported at the National Standing Control Committee meeting already been allocated leaving a balance of 821,500.
Of 11.14 Dr, Seaborn said that he was a little confused.
He mentioned the history of the Alcohol Foundations in Australia and how a national body had been formed to act as co-ordinator.
He considered that proposals by the State bodies belonging to the Foundation for Research and Treatment of Alcoholism of Australia should first submit projects to the national body for evaluation.
He asked if ary future proposals by a voluntary organisation with e national body in existence could be submitted first to the national body.
Alcoholism in queensland for which funds were taken from licensing fees.
He asked if Queensland could possibly be at a disadvantage because they did not have an organisation affiliated with a national body.

The subcommittee agreed that it was not desirable to separate the one leaflet from the kit for this particular purpose.
A pamphlet was in preparation which would be more suitable.
It would therefore be more appropriate for Victoria to consider distribution of a leaflet to Pharmacy Guild members as part of the State programme or 1972/73.

Natinal Archives of Australia A Department of Health Melbourne Department of Customs and Excise, Dear Sir, re Drug Educatin Programme I desire to refer to previous correspondence which indicated that the allocatin to this State for the above purposes for the financial year 1977/72 was 4703,5O and that the budget was: Health Educatin Centre (Drug Dependency) Mental Health - Programme Evaluation Research As you are no doubt aware, Project II is a programme of evalua- tin research being carried out by the Mental Hygiene Branch with the Assistance of the Mental Health Institute to study the pattern of drug use among young adults in the under 25 age group The study is now nearing completin but it is apparent from results so far that the survey, which was based upon respondents drawn from secondary schools and universities, does not include the large number of students who do not continue their secondary school educatin beyond Form 3.
This group is considered to be vulnerable and a bias in the results of the project could be present if the group is not It is estimated that an additional 3,000 would be required to cover normal costs of interviewing and of data processing a representative group of such respondents.

The proposed programme is additional to the current programme planned under the Grant of $35,830 for this Financial Year.
The additional programme is considered essential for these reasns: 7. The urgent need to step-up the programme in country areas owing to the exadus of great numbers of young people to coastal districts to find employment.
The position has arisen out of the years of drought and the continuing fall- off both in value and demand for primary products.
Both factors have continued to lessen job opportunities.
2. The extra capital cost in comparison with States with more concentrated populations, of reaching queensland's scattered 17/2/72), which have yet to be substantiated, of increases in drug taking and drug trafficking in Brisbane.
Iftthese inferences have even slight bases of authenticity, then the programme in Brisbane should be stepped -up immediately.
Much can be done before 3th June, 1972 but it will be necessary to initiate these additional activities at once.
The additional activities proposed are as follows- 1.
The release of one of the Council's experienced drug education officers from duties in the Metropolitan areas for the proposed increase in activity in country areas.
2. To increase the participation ofpart-time lecturers in Metropolitan areas to fill the gap which would be created by the transfer of this experienced drug education officer to country itineraries.

The estimate attached has been based on these proposals and shorn under these headings: 7. Cost of additional country itineraries.
3. Training of teachers.

Dear Sir, Folloming the advice of the Chairman, National Standing Control Committee at the recent meeting in Tasmania that funds were available for special projccts, details of two projects are To provide further training for the part-time Health Educators (Drugs) who received some basic training during 1971 and to provide additional personnel to ensure the continuation of the community education programme, funds are sought to commence a more comprehensive training programme.

The Drug Education campaign is an integral part of the In October last the Connonwvealth approved a financial allocation of 40,7C0 to enable the State to mount a programme of drug education.
I am gratified by the public support for the programme.
Indeed, the demand for the service offered together with unexpectedly high increases in salaries and other costs, has created a state of financial embarrassment.
The October decision, whitch reduced the State allocation from the $61;000 sought, forced a reduction of activity hitch can be measured by the fact that two health educator group workers have been retrenched over a period.
Having created a vigorous demand for its services, party ocularly in the field of drug education, the Council is not now able to satisfy that demand.
A survey of cipenditure at the current level of activity indicates that the Council would be faced with a deficit The Council has a reputation interstate and even overscas which testifies to its good work.

National Archives of Australia DIRECTOR general OF HEALTH SERVICES TASMANIA Re: Drug Education Ehibit Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery At last week's meeting of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence in Devonport, submissions were invited for the use of unallocated funds during the current financial year.
I submit for your consideration my request for 83,O00 to develop a proposed Drug Education Exhibit Mr. Ellis, the Director has furnished my Director of Public Health with schematic diagrams which I am enclosing together with a letter setting out the rationale behind the exhibit.
Mr. Ellis is calling at this Department on Thursday 7th February, to inform of his progress, and I shall forward details to you.
Previously, Mr. Ellis had a very successful exhibit on the dangers of smoking and he followed it up with a questionnaire analysis of its possible long term benefits.
This proposed exhibit would be especially meritorious in that it can travel to other States and truly become not only part of the National Drug Education Programnme, but the property of the Commonwealth Government.
Yours sincerely, Director-General of Health Services National Archives of Australia QUEEN VICTORIA MUSEUM AND ART GALLERY Director of Public Health, This letter follows the lines discussed with Mr. Farmer last week and is intended to inform you of the direction and development of the drug education display.
Following adoption of the general plan for the project, we required information on the motivation factors which we are to counter and the intellectual characteristics of the group(s) concerned.
The publications you supplied have provided some of the former and, as you see by the notes attached, I have concluded (7) that correspondence exists betwmeen the reasons presented by subjects and observers, indicating their validity.
(2) that these factors can be graded by the level of intellectual activity and active social involvement displayed, possibly matching the intelligence of the subsects concerned.
As you may recall, we suspect a division in the response to your previous exhibit ''smoking and cancer'' according to the intelligence of the children who viewed its the average to lower level groups conforming to the information and advice supplied authoritively while some highly intelligent individuals showed a tendency to question, even to take a counterposition, thus reversing the effect desired.
Obviously, we must not present any inducement to experiment with drugs.
We can design a display, appealing and comprehensible to intelligent people, which would not convey any significant message to those of low intelligence.
Can you tell me if Australian drug subjects are skemed u or don the average Lee scale?
I suspect the majority may be more active intellectually than average, in which case we can weight our display accordingly, as suggested above.
he At present, I envisage the theme of the display as shown on the diagram attached.
The main theme will be the moral structure and function of the nervous system.
Temporary impairment of this normal function by analgesics and anaesthetics can be compared to permanent impairment by disease and organ damage.
Fluctuating between these effects, according to the substances taken, quantities and duration, lie the effects of drugs.
This, I believe, will allow us to warn of the severe irreversible effects but hold out some hope of recovery in other cases.
It also allows discussion on some effects of drugs through those of other causes, obviating undue obvious emphasis on the drug The main elements of the presentation would be:; The nervous system - structure and function.
The effects of mechanical damage - trephining by primitive surgery, neurosurgery, effects of road accidents etc.
The effects of disease - tl, used as anaesthetics, analgesics, and other pharmaceutical purposes, with their general effects, combined Yours sincerely, National Archives of Australia DRUG EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS PROPOSED workshop CONFERENCE BASIC PURPOSE OF WORKSHOP To bring appropriate officers of Education Departments together to work out times of development for programs and materials for use in schools to counteract pressures on young people to embark on drug taking.
SE College to be used if available.
OUTLINE OF PROGRAM The Workshop should review the patterns of drug abuse among young people in Australia and in relevant conditions overseas, and endeavour to identify the circumstances that lead to drug abuse in this age group, and ways in which school programs may combat these.
The bulk of the Workshop's time should be spent in pursuing the general objective outlined above.
This might best be done by break- ing the membership into smaller groups to discuss and report on aspects of the problem.
The success of the Workshop will depend on, among other things, adequate preparatory work, which should include situation statements covering the current situation (provision for drug education, problems, etch) in each State as well as background information likely to be useful to workshop members.
Preparatory work, including arrangements for the Workshop itself, would be likely to take several months.

National Archives of Australia A spirited debate has developed in Australia and in many other countries about the effects of marihuana on man and the need for legal restraint on the availability of cannabis preparations.
The social and emotional issues which cloud clear thinking in this debate are further complicated by a general lack of knowledge of the true effects and hazards of marihuana use.
It is true that there is a wealth of data on the effects of marihuana.
Unfortunately, these data emanate from widely scattered studies which have little in common as regards approach, method and definition.
Valid comparison between such studies is difficult but it is known that marihuana is an intoxicant, a property it shares with other drugs that affect the mind.
Scientifically reliable studies have shown the potential of the drug to distort perception of time and space, to modify mood, to impair judgment and co- ordination and to initiate unpredictable behaviour.
Evidence of brain and liver damage from long term use in the individual is available and there is also the possibility of damage to the unborn child.
These effects, both mental and physical, point to disturbing possibilities.
larine end other drug The plant Cannabis Sativa (Indian Hemp) and the drugs derived from it are known by many different names.
hat is Comonly called marihuana consists of a mature of dried, crushed, leaves, flowers and twigs of the cannabis plant.
National Archives of Australia This should not be confused with the concentrated resin tt from the flowering tops of the female plant which is known as hashish or charas.
The resin contains a high concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, and is many times the potency of marihuana.
No drug, no matter how thoroughly tested, is entirely safe.
Even valuable drugs used in medical treatment involve some hazards and can cause undesirable side effects.
However, marihuana is in a special class in that it has no use in medical treatment and until recently scientific evaluation has not been attempted.
Governments are often charged with being inconsistent in allowing the use of alcohol and tobacco while prohibiting marihuana, which its advocates consider to be less harmful.
There is no doubt that both alcohol and tobacco when abused are dangerous, dependency-inducing drugs.
Society might have been better without them.
They have, however, been with us for centuries and are firmly imprinted in the fabric of modern society.
In these circumstances it would be foolish to believe that any attempt at prohibiting either of them could now be successful.
But the fact that our society suffers from and yet tolerates tobacco and alcohol is no reason why we should accept marihuana.
It is not logical to demand the addition of a third possible hazard to mankind simply because two others of a similar kind already exist.
National Archives of Australia The question does not only concern marihuana nor marihuana versus alcohol but rather how many intoxicants we can add to our already excessive consumption and still have a healthy The Australian Government, along with the governments of most countries, believes that in the present state of knowledge it would be irresponsible to alter legislation to allow the use of yet another intoxicating drug.
Thought provoking evidence As has already been pointed out, available scientific evidence suggests that the use of marihuana is extremely unwise.
But, Since the question of the safety of marihuana is often debated, it is worth listing effects that have been noted in recent scientific studies.
Brain damage A significant report was published in the December 4, Neurology, Bristol Royal United Hospitals.
In part, it said: roar findings indicate that there is a particular pattern of cerebral atrophy in a series of young men who smoked cannabis.
Although amphetamines and ISD may have an added effect, they are rapidly metabolised and excreted and would not seem likely to have the cumulative effect on nervous tissue of National Archives of Australia the fat-soluble components of cannabis.
We feel that our results suggest that regular use of cannabis produces cerebral atrophy in young Pharmacology,.
University of Oxford, and his colleagues reported experiments which suggested that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient of cannabis, may be absorbed by body fats and p. 1262).
They also noted deformities in newborn rats and liver Department of Pharmacology, Medical College of Georgia, U.S.A., have also Suggested that repeated doses of marihuana extract could drugs like marihuana and ISD may be capable, through a complex chemical process in the body, of affecting the development of the unborn during pregnancy.
He has said: ''It's something less than smart for pregnant women to smoke marihuana''.
Michael kew, of the Department of Medicine, University of Witwatersrand, South Africa, ''found disfunctions of the liver in 8 out of t2 male marihuana smolders none of whom was a heavy driller National Archives of Australia Dr. Walter Lehmann, an American pediatrician and specialist in adolescent medicine, who directs an American rehabilitation foundation, has tested 2,000 drug dependent persons.
In a recent interview he said: ''Of nearly a thousand youngsters hooked on hard drugs with whom I have worked, all but one started with marihuana.
That doesn't necessarily mean that today's noth user is tomorrow's heroin addict, but it certainly indicates that he is a prime candidate''.
Recent experiments have strongly suggested that marihuana can impair mental performance.
One of the most important tests was carried out by a group at the Stanford University School of Medicine, California among University graduate students.
The group included Dr. Leo Hollister of the Department of Medicine and Drs.
Frederick Melges and Jared Tinklenberg from the Department of Psychiatry.
The test showed that subjects under the influence of marihuana suffered confusion concerning their sense of time and this as attributed to interference with their shorty term and immediate further tests by the Stanford Group suggest that this 'temnoral disintegration, or the blurring of the past, present and future for the individual, causes him to experience himself as strange and unreal (depersonalised) during marihuana intoxication National Archives of Australia Such an experience can cause the individual to fear that loss of identity and control of self may not end, and actus anxiety and a panic reaction may arise.
Psychiatrist Martin Weeler of the Medical University of South Carolina believes that re-occurrence of the panic effects may be relatively common and that in some cases it can constitute Artistic creativity math Marihuana allegedly augments creativity.
Doctor Donald Louria, Cornell University Medical College, New York, writes in ''On a substantial number of occasions creative people have deliberately been given marihuana and asked tc carry out and interpret their artistic activity under the drug's influence.
In the majority of cases, during the actual period of marihuana intoxi- cation they felt that their creative activities were enhanced.
However, almost uniformly, when the effects of the marihuana had dissipated and they again viewed their creative activities, they found that in actuality they had done very badly.''
(The Drug Scene, The question Can we afford to accept the unknown hazards of National Archives of Australia There are many unknowns about marihuana but one thing is at least well ectaplished.
The longterm effects of marinuama usare are quite simply unknown.
It also seems obvious that usage of the drug can prcmctc anexpccted social disadvantagas.
For these reasons the best attitude to marihuana is surely to dis- courage its use.
National Archives of Australia During 1974/72, States were allocated the following State Victoria Queensland Tasmania Category B - new but necessary to support this year.
National Archives of Australla These category priorities were allocated by most States before submitting their proposals to the Drug Education which had not already submitted priorities should be requested to do so and a consolidated fact sheet listing A, B and C priorities should be submitted to the National Standing Control Committee for consideration together with details submitted concerning State programmes.
Copies of State programmes are National Archives of Australia department OF PUBLIC HEALTH 9-13 YOUNG STREET Department of Health, yr Dear Sir William, I have pleasure in forwarding a budget submission requesting funds for the financial year 1972-73 to support the Drug Education Programme in New South Wales.
In support of these proposals I am able to say that considerable prod egress has.
been made in implementing the plan put forward for this State in October, 1970.
A report on the first 12 months has already been submitted to the National Standing Control Commnittee at its last meeting and the minutes record general approval of the programme by the members on that occasion.
A copy is attached for your further perusal.
Looking ahead to the forthcoming year, it is clear that while the basic organisation for technical services, training, field services for areas with a high risk of drug abuse and evaluation remains adequate, the pre- sure on the project has become greater than it can currently support in two respects: (a) the education of key professional groups such as teachers, medical practitioners, pharmacists, nurses, clergy and lccal government officials; (b) field programmes to serve the country areas of the State.
I therefore find it necessary to seek to increase the temporary full time staff by two Health Education Officers to meet these needs as 1.
Special Project Health Education Officer.
This officer will be responsible for organising and administering educational facilities for special key groups.
He will for example assist the educationist with our series of teacher workshops, since the Education Department has requested that attempts be made to provide at least one trained teacher in each high school by the end of the 1972-73 year.
This will require at least 30 workshops to be arranged.
He will also assist in augmenting the education programme for large professional groups such as nurses, with whom work has already started but the demand is too great to be met by the educationist without assistance.
2. Country Towns, One Additional Health Education Officer.
It is apparent that the one country officer now available cannot meet the many requests to initiate programmes in country areas.
workshops in selected towns for training opinion leaders and groups It is proposed to serve the country areas by setting up regional of approved educators and by assisting local communities with the organisation of preventive programmes.
This will also allow the education Department to meet its stated elective of having a ''key teacher'' in country schools as well as in the metros polish.
The necessary liaison and organisation will require that the State be divided into two sections, each served by In seeking these two new appointments, l would emphasise that they are in consequence of a steady and reasonable growth in service to meet increased community requests which cannot be provided for by the existing staff.
This Department is fully committed to an extensive programme of health education, maintaining a considerable staff and providing many sport services and publications from State resources.
You will be aware that part of the material used in the nationwide drug education programme has originated in New South Wales.
However, it would not be possible for the Department to assume the additional costs of the intensive drug programme as the current direct costs of health education to the State exchequer are already in excess of $250,000.
I have indicated priorities against project items in the budget.
Yours faithfully, Under Secretary.

DRUG EDUCATION PROGRAMME No.A A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST VEAR Preamble Te Diision of Health Education of the New South Males Health Department has deveooed a The education programme is preventive in nature an has, as is major obiective, the formation of discriminatory attitudes towards rug use general.
The philosophy is to discuss facttaly and alcohol usage which should be considered by responsible indivuals.
National Archives of Australia : The programme is preventive in nature.
The main air is to prevent the uncommitted from adopting habits which could lead to drug dependency.
It is based on the general adoption of more discriminating attitudes towards using mind-altering 3. The programme attempts to present drug use and abuse as one of a number of related social issues.
Drug abuse is not seen as an isolated phenomenon but as a reaction to many environmental pressures.
Such reactions by young people particularly involve responses to authority and parents and may find expression in permissiveness and public protest.
4. In one sense, drug abuse is seen as a symptom of poor current mental health in some sections of the community.
The programme is based on group discussion of all these issues.
Individual behaviour and attitudes are influenced by peer pressures, commonly identification with a group and respect for the values of admired persons.
Discussion is used largely as the medium through which such external forces act and the programme aims to open up the whole issue of drugs and their potential for abuse in frank discussion based on factual information supplied continuously by the project staff.
The programme has only minimal use for lectures without discussion, for 'horror' films, and for methods which use fear or threats as the mayor persuasive tools.
7. Myths and legends, some dangerous (eg.
heroin is nonaddicting, marihuana is a narcotic) develop where a vacuum of fact exists.
Up to date facts on the effects of drugs, educational methods and social factors are distributed through pamphlets, regular bulletins and in person by experts who are relatively well informed.
8. Members of the community are not regarded as passive recipients of information, but rather as active participants both in planning and implementing local programmes which are encouraged to develop in each community.
The Drug Education Section provides continuing resources in personnel and information.
The Drug Education Programme makes referrals where appropriate.
There are sixteen Youth Advisory Centres in Sydney which have been partly financed by the Drug Education Programme, where young people can receive counseling and help when problems arise.
A person with a drug problem requiring treatment is referred to the appropriate treatment centre.
Organisation of the Drug Education Project General Administration 1.
The project is under the direction of a psychiatrist experienced in community mental health programmes, assisted by a psychologist.
2. The support unit, which includes an educationist responsible for provision of many forms of training programmes for professional health, judicial, welfare and teaching personnel requiring them, a sccial scientist and a technical information officer.
National Archives of Australia Some fifty Approved Educators have been trained to provide part time lecturing, group leading and other services in the community.
Approved Educators are usually graduates from such fields as Law, Pharmacology, Medicine, Education and those with professional training in group leadership and youth work who have undertaken training in drug education.
Their community services are organised through the regional Drug Education Officers on a sessional basis and they are available at times suitable for community meetings including evenings and Some of the Drug Education Activities In the past year, the Health Education Officers have carried out preventive programmes in many areas in Sydney.
The programmes vary according to the needs of different areas but for the most part consist of continuing lectures, discussion groups and consultation.
Some tret populations tor these programmes have been - 1. Schools, both public and non governmental.
4. Industrial training apprentice groups including the press and armed services.
7. Hospital nurses both undergraduate and graduate.
8. Community organizations, especially those with counselling functions.
9. Colleges of Education both governmental and non governmental.
National Archives of Australia Workshops and Seminars ene oi the most important functions of the programme is to conduct workshops and sermninars for key persons in the community.
These are people who by virtue of their position in the community (doctors, teachers, etch) influence others in their dally work.
A nine week seminar (one evening per week) was held for teachers from ll departmental and nondepartmental schools in the area.
A workshop of 9 hours' duration was held for 25 teachers from ive schools located in 4 Workshops for teachers from over 60 departmental schools covering 5 school days are being held in November and December.
These workshops provide a background to the nonmedical use of drugs, an opportunity to review teaching methods and materials in educating about drugs and an awareness of preventive methods open to teachers.
2. Community Workers (a) Manly area A workshop of 20 hours' duration was held for community workers.
The group consisted of Drug Referral Centre Counsellors, trained nursing sisters, psychologists, teachers and social workers.
A workshop was held for psychologists and social workers covering 6 working days.
This workshop was designed to increase knowledge of the circumstances relating to the abuse of drugs and local facilities and methods for prevention and treatment.
A workshop of 15 hours' duration was held for doctors and senior medical students, several members of paramedical professions and some group discussion leaders from the Mental Health Further workshops are planned for medical, paramedical staff, social workers, psychologists, staff from Child Health Centres, armed forces officers and for teachers from the National Archives of Australia A Committee for the Prevention of Drug Abuse has been formed in Newcastle.
A five day training programme has been conducted and eight persons have been approved as Educators.
Discussion group sessions have been held at several of the major industrial plants.
Other discussions have been held in local high schools (private and state) as well as with numerous Youth Groups.
One day seminars have been hed for opinion leader groups - local clergy, professional youth workers and selected school teachers.
The Necastle Youth Service has been approved as the local co urinating body to carry out drug education activities for the year 1971-72 with assistance from the Department of The Wollongong and District Drug Committee has completed a local five day workshop mainly designed to tain and select approved eduvcators.
Sessions are planned for local P. 8 C. groups, the Naval unit at Nowra, University groups and industry.
A workshop for staff officers of Australian lorn and Steel is being planned.
As in Necastle this Committee will be in overall charge of the local programme with Health Department assistance.
Preparatory work has been done in Goulburn where a programme in drug education is being planned.
A number of key people from various agencies will plan the programme with the regional Health Education Officer, who will act as a consultant to the group.
Planning is in progress with community leaders under the leadership of the Medical Officer of Health., North Western District, to develop a Drug Edueation Programme in these A Drug Education Programme has been organized in the central coastal area, involving Gosford Shire residents who have attended a training workshop at the Department of Health.
A Youth Leadership Seminar is shortly to be held in Sydney for young people from the central coast youth organisations interested in the problem.
Publiec meetings have been held at Etalong to elicit public views on the local needs.
National Archives of Australia Research A survey on drug knowledge, attitudes and behaviour on a random household sample of 2epproximately 1,000 people in each of the Manly and Sutherland districts is nearing completion.
The analysis will proceed over the next two months.
A followup survey will be conducted in about two years in the same areas to determine changes in the light of vigorous drug education programmes now being conducted in these areas.
The effectiveness of the various education methods being employed are under continuous review by the research team.

The special problems caused by the geographic nature of Queensland as well as its dependence on primary industry requires special consideration.
With the years of drought and the continuing fall off, both in value and demand, for primary products, are continuing to lessen job opportunities for young people.
Many western towns are reported to be loosing population and great numbers of young people from these areas are going to coastal districts for job training and subsequent employment.
The proportion of metropolitan population to rural population in Queensland is 40/60.
This proportion is unique among the Australian States.
In others, the proportion is approximately Not only has Queensland a greater rural population, but the distribution is over a greater area of country.
This is shown by the greater number of cities of more than 20,000 population, between centres of population are greater.

A pilot programme has been conducted at Campbelltow Technical High School, hangs College and Westminster College.
Based on an evaluation of this pilot programme, a future programme in secondary schools is being planned and developed.
A further training course for additional Health Educators is currently being structured and planned.
A Seminar was held in November, 1971, for Government and State by the South Australian Faculty of the Royal Australian Oollege of General Practitioners.
Several Offioers of the Drug Education Unit will be actively involved in the programme which is being arranged by the Preventive Mcdicine Committee of the College.

(to improve acoustics Carpet A STUDY of DRUG USE AND ABUSE IN SOUTH austria An outline of a research proposal Public Health Department.
Superintendent Port Adelaide Central Mission 64 Dale Street National Archives of Austala The drug scene in South Australia is an area of public health where accurate information is all too sparse.
Some valuable work has been done in analysing the use of a variety of drugs but even this has been hampered by difficulties involved in gaining access to appropriate records.
In the main, public opinion has been formed by press reports, fins and television programmes that tend to sensationalise rather than educate.
Discussions with General Practitioners usually result in assertions that the 'drug problem'''in Adelaide is of a minor nature.
The consequences of excessive consumption of alcohol and the addictive quality of nicotine are said to be of far greater significance to personal health and social functioning.
Reference is also made to the multitude of prescriptions for Popular opinion seems to associate 'drug taking'' with university students, hippy communities and the art world.
More recent information draws attention to the drug taking habits of middle aged, stay-at-home housewives and the trend towards experimenting with drugs among secondary school students.
There is also concern about the consumption of certain drugs by elderly members of the community.
It is believed that Australia will follow the patterns discerned in the United Kingdom and North America because of our similarity in life styles.
Our comparative affluence and high degree of urbanisation are other factors which point to Australia experiencing a 'drug problem' similar to that in the overseas areas mentioned.
While there is a continuing flow of research material from overseas, little basic research has been commissioned in Australia.
One of the reasons for lack of research here is the cost involved in carrying out reliable work.
Much time has to be spent in defining the field of research in precise terms, designing research procedures, gathering the material and processing the data.
After much time and effort, the findings not infrequently confirm conclusions that have already been drawn by intuition or informed opinion.
However, it can be argued that it would be reassuring to know that one's hunches were supported by reliable research data, especially when the expenditure of public monies on community education programmes were involved.
Bearing in mind then, the shortage of objective data and the confusion which seems to surround the drug scene in South Australia, the following proposal is submitted for consideration.
2. Research Objectives 1.
A statistical analysis of the use of drugs in South Australia, especially in the metropolitan area of Adelaide.
2. A survey of community attitudes towards drug use and abuse.
3. A survey of the incidence of drug abuse in South Australia together with the personal and social consequences of same.
An evaluation of the existing public health drug education 5. Reference to the implications of the findings in l to4 in positing a comprehensive community drug education programme.
It is proposed that the research project be spread over two years.
In year one, emphasis would be placed upon definition National Archives of Australia of the research, statistical analysis and questionnaire design.
Some preliminary findings could be available after six months but the bulk of the findings from actual fieldwork would not be available until the second year.
Close co-operation with the Department cf Public Health would be necessitated by the need to define 'drugs'' and to establish 2. The project would be supervised by the staff of Port Adelaide Central Mission.
A qualified staff member would be retained part-tiScoordinate the project.
Consultants in sociology, questionnaire design and education would be retained on a sessional basis.
It would also be essential to purchase computer time to facilitate the processing of material.
A cooperative relationship would be established with the Australian Medical Association, Mental Health Services and the Police Drug Squad.
3. Literature from culturally similar countries would be reviewed together with an appreciation of research carried out in Australia.
4. Most of the field work would be based on Adelaide but it is felt that a limited study could also be warranted in a town like Port Lincoln where it is thought that 'drug running'' presents less hazards than Port Adelaide.
Interviews in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Newcastle could also provide some basis for comparative comment. 5. All available and relevant statistical data would be examined and collated.
This would include not only statistics for the sale of particular drugs but also for the personal and social consequences of drug abuse.
An attempt would be made to bring together groups of people representative of the wider groups in the community thought to be most prone to drug dependency (e.g. a group of secondary school students would be brought together for National Archives of Australia discussions structured to produce information useful to the design and administration of questionnaires to a larger sample of students).
7. Reference would be made to experts in the design of major questionnaires.
It is believed that this is crucial to the reliable measurement of the incidence of drug abuse, prevalence in a given area and community attitudes.
The selection of sample populations would be made in close consultation with the Department of Public Health.
Then would follow the administration of the questionnaires and processing the results with the aid of a computer.
9. Findings would be tabulated and serve as the basis for achieving the research objiectives in section 2. above.
4. Populations for Investigation 2. Tertiary level students.
3. Members of the medical and paramedical professions.
7. A cross section of the general population.
In an endeavour to establish incidence, prevalence, etiology, and specific substances misused, the following represent the major factors for investigation and measurement: a) family, social class and life style c) peer group relationships d) attitudes to life e) personal experience with drugs f) perceived reasons for drug use National Archives of Australia j) attitudes concerning safety of drugs.
k) attitudes concerning legality of drugs.
i) opinions on users of marijuana o) source of supply p) agent of introduction to use q) source of favourable disposition toward drug use r) agents for introduction to drug experience and learning and interpretative experiences.
Travelling expenses at $60O per year for 2 years.
Consultants' fees Computer survey analysis Secretarial assistance Stationery, duplicating etc. Telephone, postage etc. Note: A financial statement would be forwarded to the Department as required.
In the event of any monies remaining unexpended, a refund would be made to the Department.
It is pointed out that no figure has been given for the provision of office space and equipment or for supervision by Mission staff and application of their expertise.
This would be a contribution on the part of the Missiofthe project.
National Archives of Australia Port Adelaide Central Mission has a record of more than 50 years in social welfare work.
It is an agency of the Methodist Church and is responsible to the Annual Conference of that body.
Because the agency receives grants from the State and Commonwealth Governments for specialised purposes it is also responsible to the appropriate Departments for performing certain services.
At the present time the Mission staff includes four University trained social workers and a part-time qualified teacher.
A fifth social worker will take up her appointment on lOth April.
Staff members have carried out research recently into 'Community Attitudes in Port Adelaide'' and ''The World View of Urban Aborigines.''
Both projects were also used towards University Honours work and brought a Distinction and Credit respectively.
Due to contacts with overseas and interstate agencies which have expertise in areas directly related to this research proposal, it is believed that the Mission is capable of mounting the project and carrying it through.
Close relationships have been forged with the social work section of the Institute of Technology and the Department of Sociology and Social Administration at Flinders University.
Staff members have been generous in making available their experience to the Mission for various facets of its work.
Their experience would be invaluable to the proposed research project outlined above.

HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMMES It is the policy of the Health Education Council of W.A. to deal with the drug issue in perspective.
The support of Comnmonwealth funds has made it possible to extend a Modern Social Issues programme which was already in existence.
Due emphasis has been placed on drug dependence as a major and growing problem.
These programmes have involved both adults and high school students in examining together a range of iter-related health issues focussing on parent/echild and inter personal relationships., Fifteen programmes have been conducted in Perth and eighteen in country areas.
This does not include the programmes conducted in Nursing Schools.
All pre-clinical students in metropolitan hospitals undergo a fortytwo hour programme on the role of the nurse in modern social issues.
Contacts have been strengthened with established institutions : Nursing Schools Teacher Training Colleges College of General Practitioners Child Welfare Department Youth Organisations Native Welfare Department.
Arrangements are proceeding for Social Issues programme in training institutions for professional and semiprofessional workers in these areas.
A Young Liheral Seminar about the Drug Issue was held in A specially organised Seminar was held with Church of Christ A Seminar was held for Junior Farmer Extension Officers in National Archives of Australia Staff have participated in Seminars and Conferences held by Y.M.C.A., Methodist Youth Department and various other Youth A twelve week training programme was conducted for a Methodist Youth Centre.
A two week University Summer School entitled ''Social Issues and Medicine'' was mounted in conjunction with the College of General Practitioners and the University Adult Education Service.
This created widespread public interest and gained maximum press A long-term project in a large centrally positioned youth centre was begun, but work was deferred due to financial limitations.
4. DRUG DISCUSSION SERIES A number of well-qualified part-time workers were given special training to conduct a four-part series of drug education discussions consisting of: l.
Patterns of Public Health 2. Human Relationships 3. Facts of Drug Dependence 4. Drug Dependence and the Family.
This programme was designed to cope with panic reactions to the drug question which reached mildly hysterical proportions at the end of 1970 and beginning of 197l.
The impact of this programme appeared to be successful because the clamour for speakers about 'drugs'' was short-lived.
It became clear that talks treating drugs in isolation were not the answer to basic community needs.
Just as other special information campaigns about V.D., Heart Disease or Smoking have a limited purpose, and cannot be sustained over long periods, There were sixtyone of these programmes entirely in the metropolitan area.
This series is still available, but requests are now for long-term social issues programmes.
A part time press officer has undertaken effective liaison with country newspapers and weekly periodicals as well as regular releases to daily papers, radio and television.
Locally prepared Information Bulletins were distributed to Members of Parliament, nursing schools, high schools, Child Health Centres, loceal authorities, classroom teachers and students doing project work.
Each bulletin has a distribution list of 1,200 influential Material from Commonwealth sources has been widely distributed.
The scope has been broadened of the Auxiliary Workers Training Programme which is a twelve month part-time course and embraces such organisations as Good Neighbour Council, Mental Health, Anglican Social Welfare, Police d Citizen Youth Club Supervisors, Red Cross, etc.
This provides a widespread network of informed people able to act in local 6.2 Croup Leaders A cadre of selected lay group leaders were trained to act as discussion facilitators in the Modern Social Issues and Drug Education programmes in the metropolitan area.
A second team of fourteen student-nurses completed six months' discussion training and rendered invaluable service in the Modern Social Issues programmes.
They were particularly effective with student groups.
Suhs':ntial links were established with Service Groups such as: Rotary, Apex, Jaycees and Miwanis.
These organisations have provided programme co-ordinators and discussion leaders.
A close working co-operation has been maintained with the Mental Health Services, often seen to be in the front-line of treatment of drug dependent and socially disoriented people.
Support has been given to a Human Relationships Workshop Programme and other social projects carried out by Mental Health Services.
Also exploratory meetings have been held with representatives of Police Drug Squad, Mental Health Services, Inebriates Board, and other agencies concerned with the issue of drug dependence.
9. COMMUNITY HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS WORKSHOPS A project of Community Human Relationships Workshops was commenced despite the low priority given by the N.S.C.C.D.D. A total of thirtyone workshops were conducted in the period, and thirteen more are committed.
This project was in association with Mental Health Services.
This Service has now assumed responsibility for the This project is regarded as highly successful.
It has produced a network of thirtyone informed groups, each of which has worked together for at least twentytwo weeks on this issue.
A quarterly conference of participants now operates, and plans are in hand for follow-up workshops, all of which have direct relevance to the drug issue.
Seven of these have commenced.
More of this work should be undertaken.
This developmental experience seems to have made a significant contribution to community understanding of health issues, to the extent that no major drug problem has yet emerged in Western As a result of this experience, Community Development is seen as the educational effort most likely to produce results in drug Difficulties experienced due to economic factors have caused some rctrenchment of staff and a consequent curtailment of field projects.
It is hoped, however, that these may be resumed when funds again permit.
National Archives of Australia It is still the local view that the framework of the drug education programme is appropriate and likely to be effective in minimising the growth of the drug problem.
The broad programme for 1972/75 will therefore be based on continuation of the activities already developed, with a developmental project to produce specialised teaching and discussion material for use in country areas.

The seminars programme is reduced from that of the previous year because of the excessive demands this type of presentation made upon our staff.
The Health Educator intends conducting regiohed youth seminars and training seminars More work will be fostered from within the community and an attempt will be made to work in deviant groups of the populace.
Travelling: The need for funds to run our Vollswagan Combi Vans and accommodate our staff within the State are basic to any education programme However, the request for funds for interstate travel is to enable our Health Educator to appraise some aspects of other Drug Education Programmes at first hand.
In particular, assessment of the Social Issues Programme of Western Australia is deemed to be important.
The 1972/73 programme will attempt to be strictly within the scope of our resources and the limited staff available.

2.1 Community requests for information regarding drugs have been met with a discussion programme based on the file ''Where Are We Heading?''.
2.2 Several seminars for opinion leaders have been held.,
These have resulted mainly in the identification of community leaders who now draw on our health education resources for their own organizational programmes.
A regular meeting with professional youth workers is an instance of this result.
2.3 A residential week-end for adolescents at school has given good feedback.
It is proposed to extend this programming with a view to influencing peer-group norms in areas affecting decisions on drug taking.
In addition, basic equipment requirements for this office are ben built up with the provision of tape recorders, projectors and a number of films suited to different group requirements.
I A The problem in drug education which is seen as most requiring the attention of this office is the provision of suitable, accessible trinin, in health education for practising teachers.
We accept as Committee on health education and drugs.
We see it as critical that the teacher in the class room situation receive as much support as possible in general health education procedures.
Tt is hoped that close co-operation with the Canberra College of Advanced education, School of Teacher Raining will result in the establishment of a regular programme of In the year ahead, it is proposed to improve the quality of general community programmes on drug education by extending into twc or three nihnt series as soon as suitable 'approved educators'' are available.
It is also planned to continue and expand slightly the peer-group camps for students.
It is considered that the most important of these programmes is that of teacher training; then, in priority order, the meeting of community requests for drug education programmes, peer groups week-ends, seminars for opinion leaders, the provision of more resource Acting Director.

The proposal for such a position is being submitted for National Archives of Australia TO drug squad 2 days Educational Materials d Incidentals Priority 1 (Teaching aids The scat cf the appcrticed salaries and allowances for the officers to be involved in the drug education programme 1972/73 is estimated at $14.500.
This demount has not been included into the costs to be charged against the Drug Education vote.
It will be charged, as in the past, to the operating expenses of the N.T. Health Services, unless otherwise instructed.
f sufficient funds are allocated for the proposed activities during 1972/73, the drug education programme in the N.T, could fulfil some of the educational needs that are already identified.
The basis of the drug education programme in the N.T. is that of involvement of key people in the community and the target grubs: including youths and other potential drug takers, and is vital for the success of the programme.
By bringing participants from outlying aretes such as Gove and Katherine to attend a seminar in Darwin (for teachers, youth grcup workers, social workers etc), it is anticipated that, in addition to providing a valuable experience for these people personal.

The series was to culminate in a national function in Canberra attended by representatives from State and Territory pre-seminars.
The subcommittee saw it as essential that young people should be consulted in any education programme for youth.
The objectives outlined for the series of seminars were to ascertain the kind of education programme that would fill the needs of youth, and provide assistance with their social problems, including drug abuse.
A pilot programme was conducted during March 197 in Westemn australia.

A significant number of young people are not interested in lectures/films/discussion groups as a basis for discovering scientific facts.
Consideration should be given to the use cf the media in which these people are interested.

Attached for the information of members is a report by Dr. Edmondson on a visit to the Drug Epidemiology Unit of the Medical Research Council at Chichester, Bngland.
This information is relevant to this item.
National Archives of Austalia The first meeting of the Working Party on statistics of Addiction was held on Tuesday, 23 November 197 at St. Nicholas following were present: 1. OPENING OF THE MEETING 1.
The Chairman welcomed members to the Meeting.
An apology was received from Dr. A. Bartholomew who was unable to attend as he was going overseas.
The Chairman advised that he had received a paper from Dr. Bartholomew dealing with the drug taking problem at H.M.P. Pentridge.
The paper was circulated to members at the Meeting.
1.2 The Chairman described events leading up to the formation of the Working Party by the N.H.
M.R.C. Mental Health Committee and outlined the reasons for its establishment.
2.t The Working Party had been directed to investigate the possible linking of medical and forensic approaches to the collection of statistics of addiction.
2.2 In doing gso, it would be necessary to take into account both social and ethical aspects and ensure that any system devised did not interfere with action either in the health or the penal areas.
2.3 Other important aspects to be examined were reasonable and uniform definitions as well as regular and confidential 3. PROBLEM AREAS TO BE CONSDERED 3.1 It would be necessary to consider how private sectors could be involved in the collection of statistics of addiction.
3.2 Information was required concerning psychological, economic and cultural factors.
3.3 Differences in methods of collection were apparent between States and also between the various agencies in individual National Archilves of Australia 3.4 The question of overlap by the various agencies should be 4. NEED FOR ACCURATE STATISTICS 4. The Chairman pointed out that there was a need for the collection of accurate information at a State level as 4.2 The Commonwealth required accurate uniform statistics so that its obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotics and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances could be met.
4.3 The States needed accurate information to plan essential services and programmes.
4.4 Both the Commonwealth and the States require accurate statistics in order to assess the sie of the drug dependence problem in Australia.
5.1 The Chairman pointed out that he considered the following should be considered: (i) how agreement could be reached on definitions; (ii) the collection of data from as wide an area of involvement as possible; (iv) the central collection of statistics without intimidating people; and (v) a report to the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence and to the Health Ministers' Conference.
5.2 The Chairman advised members that it would be possible to have people co-opted to the Working Party to provide special information or data.
5.3 The Chairman then described current surveys into drug behaviour being carried out by the Victorian Mental Health 5.4 Members present covered the standard Stats addiction collection, the social welfare and police areas, so it should be possible to look meaningfully into the problems 6.
INFORMATION CONCERNING CURRENT 6.1 Mr. Murdoch explained that the Commonwealth role could be better ascertained following a more comprehensive under- standing of the problems which beset the people who were actually working in the collection areas.
6.2 Detective Sergeant Currie reported on the Victorian Police 6.2.1 There was no specific definition as far as an addict was concerned.
The Police realised that there were both psychological and physical forms of addiction and they were guided by what they saw or were told by the person.
If the person said he was constantly taking morphine then they would have no hesitation in recording him as an addict.
The addiction problem would need to be obvious before the person was recorded as an addict.
6.2.2 Up until the present, marihuana smokers had not been recorded as drug dependent.
It was only on the rare occasion that the Police handled a person with withdrawal symptoms at the Office.
However, it could occur later at Pentridge or after the person was bailed out.
If the person had a drug problem, Dr. Bartholomew at Pentridge was contacted and an examination was offender was bailed out or assisted by the Buoyancy Foundation.
Often when the offender is bailed out, he later presents himself at court with a private 6.2.5 A person became a statistical unit once he committed an offence involving drugs.
The ordinary local police forms were filled in (the criminal offence and modus operandi forms).
At the Office, details were then transferred to a Drug Intelligence Report Form and this was forwarded to the Commonwealth Police in Canberra.
These forms were filled in irrespective of whether a person was charged or convicted.
62.6 Offences in order of incidence were possession easiest to prove, therefore the most common, using nd trafficking (hard to prove, therefore rare).
6.2.7 Quite a large percentage of offenders involved were not drug abusers and because of this, police statistics would overstate addiction.
National Archives of Austala 6.2.8
If one person committed more than one offence, then separate reports were made for each offence.
6.2.9 Victorian Police records were kept by detectives; the records were designed to assist them operationally not to provide a system of statistical collection.
6.3 Superintendent Williams explained that a standardised form was used by the Commonwealth Police and circulated copies to members.
He reported concerning Commonwealth Police 6.3.1 Commonwealth Police did not define an addict as such.
They did not consider themselves competent to give a medical definition of addiction.
They could only look at the offender.
They had the problem of different methods of collection by the Police in the various States e.g.
recidivist had been deleted from the present form as police in different States gave the term different 6.3.4
Records would soon be available for two complete years.
6.3.5 Offenders were not counted twice so there was no duplication at their level.
Reports from each State were checked on a name basis and if queries were raised, were sent back to States for further identification.
As fingerprints were available, these were a valuable means of identification.
Commonwealth Police were working towards uniform statistics on crime not on drug addiction.
6.4 Dr. Rutter pointed out that the main function of his area at a State Health level was to control the legal use of 6.4.1 Hallucinogens were controlled by the Victorian Health Department.
A number of psychiatrists had warrants to use L.S.D. and psilocybin but their use had reduced to almost nil.
Amphetamines have been controlled since April 1970 and there are now about ninety patients dependent on them.
Only six addicts on narcotics have been notified by doctors.
A lot of others have been treated with narcotise for periods exceeding eight weeks but it was difficult to differentiate between those dependent and those not.
Dr. Rutter knew of people who had been on methadone for up to ten years without increasing the dose.
As it was realised that a lot of Victorian doctors were not aware that it was necessary to obtain permission for the long term use of narcotics, a notice had been placed in the A.M.A. Newsletter. to advise them of State requirements.
In some cases, long term usage had been reported by pharmacists to inspectors and in this way, narcotics and Sehedule I 6.4.6
At Fairfield Hospital, all cases of serum hepatitis were notified.
6.4.7 A doctor, who prescribes restricted drugs, is given a permit for the patient for a period depending on the circumstances.
When the term has expired, the doctor is asked if he wishes to continue.
Records are not always accurate as a doctor often stops prescribing during the allowed period.
So far only two young persons have been reported as narcotic addicts.
6.5 It was reported that Dr. Bartholomew had advised that he rarely saw any cases of withdrawal.
6.6 Superintendent Milliams reported that drug offenders, notified to the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau, were usually in the younger age groups.
hypnotic addicts were seldom reported.
6.8 Dr. Chatg advised that the Adolescents Social Welfare Division provided psychiatric services to Children's Courts Referrals were by Magistrates on information presented to them.
If drugs were an issue, referral takes referred for psychiatric help.
All with drug histories are referred to the Unit.
Of 6,500 cases a year, the Unit would see 400 or National Archives of Australia 6.8.3 Emphasis is on help for the youngster rather than retribution so that communication usually is quite freely made.
The media indicates thatthe drug problem is rather large but the Unit does not see this.
Only 1-2% of the people referred have drug problems.
Cases in youngsters seen are using L.S.D., amphetamines or marihuana.
If there are numerous drug dependent youngsters, they are not coming to the notice of the Children's Courts or the Iouth Division.
6.9 Dr. Krupinski explained that the Mental Health Cumulative Register was based on the infirmation collected from admissions to institutions and clinics.
The International Classification of Diseases definition of drug dependence is used.
For the studies being carried out by the Mental Health Authority, it was decided to report usage of drugs by the person, the type, amount and frequency.
This was because the International Classification definition was capable of different interpretations by different doctors.
The operational definition established on the studies could be used and under- stood by everybody.
6.9.3 Numbers of people dependent on drugs were still not drugs frequently.
These were not necessarily addicted.
It had been recognised that cases ewers usually under- reported if special forms had to be filled in.
6.9.5 Of the 87 persons reported, there were not more than 6.9.6
Only a small number of cases of withdrawalwere seen.
6.9.7 Either the problem is not so great or cases are not just coming to the recognised services.
6.10 Dr. Bartholomew's paper outlining the drug taking problem 7. VICTORIAN STUDY OF DRUG USAGE AND 7.
This study was of persons under 30 years of age.
7.2 For Part One, over 600 know drug users were interviewed.
These cases were collected from Fairfield Hospital, the Youth Division, Penal Divisions and Buoyancy Foundation.
7.3 An addict had been defined according to the amount and frequency of administration.
These were related to the type of drug.
7.4 A clear dichotomy had appeared: (i) One group who used the lot - marihuana, barbiturates, (ii) Another group who limited themselves to marihuana, hallucinogens and amphetamines.
7.5 Some of the cases were involved in the illicit buying and selling of drugs; some were in contact with the police, some were not.
7.6 The people interviewed were not necessarily representative of all drug users.
Interviewers were paid $8 per person and interviewees received $2. 7.7 Once the obvious hard drug users were interviewed, it had been difficult to find further users.
7.8 For Part Two, a self-administered questionnaire will be given to young people in different settings: 7.9 In the pilot study carried out, it was discovered that 10% of the Fifth Form students (about 16 years of age) had experimented with drugs.
This percentage was steady for all schools in the pilot.
7.10 Questions were included concerning tobacco, alcohol and medication and the use of drug scene jargon.
7.11 Impressions gained already indicated that people are starting at an earlier age to experiment with drugs.
The problem seems to be waning at university level and is moving into the high schools.
National Archives of Australia 8.t Dr. Hrupinski suggested that arbitrary criteria for drug addiction should be accepted and these should be on an amount and frequency basis depending on the type of drug.
8.2 Dr. Rutter pointed out there were further problems concerning definition when intermittent users and the persons dependent on small doses of a drug were taken into account.
8.3 Dr. Hrupinski considered there was need for flexibility in this area.
In the drug users' study, three questions concerning their attitude towards their own addiction had been included in the questionnaire.
8.4 Members discussed the possibility of the establishment of.
8.5 Detective Sergeant Currie pointed out that many persons became addicted to their living environment before they became addicted to drugs.
Drug addiction developed gradually and abusers were reluctant to give up drugs because of the group or area in which they were living.
Most abusers had a history of disturbed family life, were living away from home, etc. 8.6 The question of anonymity in relation to a central register was discussed.
It was agreed that a person should not be able to make use of his registration and it again should not be open to use against him.
Records in a central register would require a high degree of security.
8.7 The Courts were inclined to be lenient on those dependent on drugs.
8.8 There was a further problem in Victoria as there was no place where addicts could be confined for treatment.
8.9 Many of the users are trafficking but because of their dependence receive sympathetic treatment in the courts.
8.1O The problems of getting people on the register were discussed and reference was made to the U system where registration had been encouraged because a supply of drugs was then available.
National Archives of Australia A OF STATISTICS 9.1 The Chairman printed out that a certain amount of data was available from different agencies.'
If a pilot study was undertaken in Victoria, it would then be possible to gee how the general police approach related to the health approach and ascertain the overlap.
Information could be collected from the Police, Prisons, Youth Welfare, State Health, Mental Health and Infectious Diseases areas.
9.2 Health and Police collections of statistics could be seen on parallel lines and then the two could be co-ordinated where they came into interaction.
It would then be possible to assess whether a combined' system was feasible.
9.3 Dr. Chatg enquired if the Working Party was in favour of a central drug register.
9.4 Dr. Krupinski indicated that he considered everybody from each agency should be recorded in the central register whether they had health problems or not.
9.5 The Chairman suggested that a pilot project should be carried out in New South ales as well as in Victoria.
key people in the collection areas should get together and investigate the possibility of co-operation in recording data over a period of one year.
9.6 Members agreed that the U.N. questionnaire was to complicated to hbe filled in under the present circumstances.
9.7 Dr. Mrupinski considered it would not be possible to cover barbiturate or analgesic users.
9.8 Members agreed that it would be best for the present tc concentrate on illicit drug use, that is, Schedule 8 drugs.
It would be an impossible teaks at this stage to obtain figures on dependence on barbiturates and allied drugs.
9.9 Cross matching of names was discussed and it was agreed that Dr. Krupinski and Dr. Stoller should prepare a form for this purpose.
However, there was a problem here from an ethical point of view.
Everyone contributing to the Register could be inclined to expect access to the records.
9.10 Superintendent Williams advised that he believed that there would be no objection by the Police if the National Standing Control Committee on rugs of Dependence recommended that Police should not have access.
National Archives of Australia 9. It was suggested that to obtain anonymity, it may be necessary to involve the Bureau of Census and Statistics in the collection of data.
9.12 Members agreed that the W.H.O.
definition of dependence was not suitable for use.
It would be better to use the questions from the Victorian Study Questionnaire so that an operational definition could be determined.
9.13 Members discussed the possibility of alerting the medical profession to its responsibility in reporting drug 9.14 It was agreed that it would be necessary to build in mechanisms in the collection to overcome possible overlap.
9.15 The Chairman pointed out that funds would be required to cover the extra services involved in carrying out the pilot studies in Victoria and New South Wales.
9.46 Detective Sergeant Currie agreed that the Police would endeavour to obtain more accurate answers to questions regarding type of drug, amount, duration and source within the current format.
9.7 Members agreed that the following medical sources should be involved in the pilot operations in each State: a) Poisons Division of State Health Department: 9.18 Approval for the pilot test would have to be obtained from the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence and also funds to provide the extra services required.
Permission would need to be obtained from the State Health Departments (N.S.W. and Vietoria) and the co-operation of the State agencies sought.
9.19 Victoria could offer the Mental Health Research Institute facilities to handle the pilot test in Victoria.
On the other hand, the Commonxealth Department of Health may care to become involved.
National Archives of Australia 9.2O The services of one person fulltime would be necessary.
The Working Party could offer supervision.
Finance would be required for the clerical assistance, printing of frs eg.

9.2t General hospitals would be included in the list of may be possible to co-opt somebody for the next meeting from the Medical Records Section of the general hospitals area, also somebody from the Bureau of Census and Statistics.
The Working Party on Statistics of Addiction recommended that: (i) a report should be prepared on the deliberations of the Working Party and submitted to the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence before referral (ii) the National Standing Control Committee should be advised (a) at this stage it would not be practicable to include barbiturates and allied drugs in any statistical collection of drug dependent persons; (b) before proceeding further towards any uniform system of collection on a nation -wide basis, a pilot study should be conducted for one year in Victoria and also in New South Wales, if this was possible; (c) finance will be required to implement the pilot study to cover the services (clerical) of one person full- time, the printing of relevant forms and the processing of data; (d) health and police authorities should collect statistics along parallel lines and the following medical services should be involved in the pilot operations in each State: poisons Division of State Health Department mental Health Facilities .Priscn Medical Services Youth Welfare Services Infectious Diseases Agencies Voluntary Service Agencies (e) some central Supervisory body should be nominated to oversee the pilot studies in the two States.
The Drug Taking Problem at H.M.P. Pentride 1.
We have no real idea just what the problem size is as far as the prison is concerned.
This is because: (a) many persons who are drug dependent are charged with offences which cover up the drug problem e.g.
Breaking and entering; (b) the social welfare department has no efficient or effective statistical scheme such as that under the direction of Dr rupinski which permits of an ongoing personal documental- 2. We are aware that the drug problem in Pentridge is increasing, and increasing at a fairly rapid rate simply in terms of clinical 3. The drug takers we see in Pentridge come in two main forms: (a) ''xperimenters'' who have got into trouble after one or two experimental endeavours.
These persons require little or no psychiatric treatment - simply being ''caught'' and dealt with frightens them out of their behaviour; (b) those who are more certainly hooked - dependent.
Some of these persons are seriously psychiatrically ill.
Often they are not recognised until well into their sentence; others are found when doing presentence reports.
however, psychoses that there is little hope of doing more than controlling their withdrawal symptoms and giving very superficial counselling.
This is a cause of considerable annoyance to the drug dependent offender who tends to feel 4. Nothing very much can be done until: (a) we know more certainly who are the drug dependent persons.
This means better communication with the police - all such persons, however charged, should be communicated to the prison medical authorities; (b) an effective statistical system so that old findings are permanently recorded - this means that aliases must be allowed for; workers if we can do more than document such persons; National Archives of Australia (d) we need hospital beds - with the forensic staff having some access to a number for their own patients.
No one is very interested in simply weeding out interesting cases for other persons to treat; (e) the present complex psychological research must be improved or else the staff will not wish to find the drug cases - it makes the work load too great and the prisoners dislike it.
I was able to spend a whole day at this Unit with Dr. de Nlarcon, ho was until recently the fulltime head of the Unit.
For ths past month he has been in a ew position at Southlaltor University, thigh is not far away, end has been working only two days per eek with the MRC.
The Unit as formed following some initial work which Dr. de Alarcon end another neychitrist did :hilst there was an unusual appearance of heroin use in adolescents.
They investigated various sources of formation in rather en ad hoc manner and found that there ware number of sources which could be useful in dissevering heroin users, although some were better than others.
Mmongst the sources which were used for information at that tim ere a time were knomn to the police.
At that time their interest was directed principally tods the discovery of heroin and entrenous methndrine users, but some other rugs were also netcd.
He eplained that he believed that they were etremely lucly in this initial investigation in that the cult of drug abuse had only very recently started and that the abusers were 'in their honeymoon of drug abuse''.
They still had social contact with other people as well as onset themselves and still felt free to talk about their drug buss.
Ir this investigation they obtained good co-operetion with all ths good turns for them in the past and, as he eplained, they were 'otai.

Tt is noted that drug abusers have certain personality problems and pose difficulties in security which are not acceptable to many doctors and nurses.
The problems which arise re rather more akin to those which arise in mental hospitals rather than in general hospitals.
However, Dr. de Alarcon has no particular preference for beds in any particular hospital but believes that it is suite rensonahle to treat them in any kind of hospital environment.
He is of importance at the present time in Australia since facilities for treatment of drug abuse are under consideration by all Stetes.
In order to keep up the interest of the general practitioner, who is probably most easily liable to forget the in the area once during the year.
This visit is explained as part of a ''survey''.
In his visit he asks about drug users, checks on those who are already known to the Unit or are known to be patients of the particular detor.

He believes this personal visit is eaeential to hold the doctors interest and suggests that eny sort of correspondence or form would not be successful.
The Register is not intended to be permanent but merely a research tool, although Dr. de Hlarcon suggests that, once established, it would not be unreasonable to keep a register of this kind going for a very long period.
A number of projects have been carried out using this Register ts a research toll.
The following are examples: (i) In evaluation of the effects of legislation to (ii) Studies of the chronicity of drug dependence in fail relationships, etc. of drug abusers with a control group to find social correlates; and xvii) A longitudinal study in schools to see if any predictors of drug abuse can be uncovered.

National Archives of Australia Agenda Item U.N. CONFERENCE TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS TO THE SINGLE convention ON NARCOTIC DRUGS 96 The abovementioned conference was held in Geneva from Ninety four countries were represented at the conference.
The Australian delegation comprised: Mr. G.E. Sheen, Department of Customs and Excise, Alternate Australia was represented on the Credentials Committee and Committees I and II.
Most countries were represented on Committees I and II which the conference had agreed would each consider a share of the proposed Amendments.
Because of this the major discussion took place in Committee rather than in Plenary.
THE PROTOCOL: The protocol enters into force following ratification or accession by States which have ratified or acceded to the Single THE MAIN PROVISIONS: Attached is a statement which sets out: (a) the existing related provisions of the Single Convention; (b) the provisions of the Protocol; and (c) a brief explanation of each provision.
The more significant Amendments contained in the Protocol relate to estimates and the powers and functions of the International Narcotic Control Bard (I.N.C.B.).
Comments in relation to these provisions are contained in the following paragraphs.
Article 9 of the Protocol amends Article 19 of the Single Convention to require Parties to provide estimates for: (a) the area to be used in the cultivation of opium poppy; (b) the quantity of opium to be produced: (c) the number of factories which will manufacture synthetic drugs; and (d) the quantity of synthetic drugs to be manufactured by each In supporting the provisions relating to opium the Australian delegation explained our position concerning the planting of opium in one calendar year and the harvesting in the following year.
We emphasised that, while we were prepared to look at alternative proposals, our estimates for the area of opium poppy cultivation for a particular year would be the actual area planted in the previous year.
No alternative proposals were received.
If Australia adopts the Protocol it will be required to furnish estimates for the area of opium poppy to be cultivated despite the fact that the crop will not be used for opium The amendments in relation to synthetic drugs were supported by opium producing countries.
These Amendments were an effort to remove the discrimination which opium producing countries felt resulted from all the Amendments relating to opium.
Australia did not support the amendments in relation to (a) there was no definition of ''symthetic drug''; and (b) the usefulness of the Amendment could not be demonstrated.
POWERS OF THE I.N.C.B.: and 21 bis respectively of the Single Convention) relate to the posers of the I N.C.B. Conference agreed that, in the case of disagreement betmeen a party and the I.N.C.B. on the estimate submitted for any drug, the The I.N.C.B. representative explained that it was up to the exporting country to then decide whether to adopt the estimate of the importing country or that of the I.N.C.B.
The I.N .C.B. was also empowered to reduce a party's estimate for opium in cases where any excess of production by that party found its way into the illicit traffic.
This provision was intended to encourage all parties to introduce proper controls.
The powers of the IN.C.B. were broadened by the Amendments in such areas as the rights of the Board to require explanation; to bring certain circumstances to the notice of parties and international bodies and to visit a country.
However, there is as an overriding requirement that the I.N.C.B. must always consult and, in some areas, have the agreement of the party concerned before the Board can exercise these powers.
National Archives of Australia GENERAL COMMENTS: The principal objections to the broadening of the Bard's powers under Articles 14, 19 and 2 bis of the Convention were voiced by opium producing countries and Eastern Bloc countries.
The grounds for their opposition were as follows- (a) the proposals offended international law in that they empowered the Board to intrude upon the sovereignty. of parties; (b) the Board already had adequate powers; proposals were discriminatory against opium producing countries; and (d) the reduction of estimates by the amount used for illicit purposes could result in shortages for bona fide medical purposes.
The remaining articles of the Protocol predominantly reflect the kinds of measures the conference deemed it was desirable for parties to adopt.
Much of the strength of the Protocol is removed by the reservation provisions which apply to all of the more significant Amendments mentioned above.
Nevertheless the Protocol may prove worthmhile inasmuch as it should encourage parties to take more stringent measures to prevent drug trafficking.
