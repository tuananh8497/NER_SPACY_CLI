.Extent of heroin use by women is not well documented but evidence contained in NSW Women in Prison Task Force Report suggests that use of heroin is a particular problem APPENDIX (From Report of the NSW Task Force on Women in offences.
A study revealed that 78% of women in custody had a history of drug and/or alcohol use, heroin being the drug most frequently used.
The incidence of drug/alcohol use was higher among young women aged The Task Force concluded that prison is an inappropriate The aims of rehabilitation to promote change and present new life options - to offer information about drug use Imprisonment is counterproductive and perpetuates the cycle of homelessness, poverty and unemployment in which many drug dependent women are caught up.
The majority of women in NSW prisons are young and working class and, being female and working class, are disadvantaged in terms of educational and employment There is evidence of a high correlation between a history of sexual abuse and drug dependency in women.
Many drug-dependent women may have sexual problems - anxiety and guilt over sexual history - use of sexuality to barter for necessities of life.
Services for drug-dependent women need to be directed towards their needs for educational, vocational training, employment and counselling for sexual abuse as well as their drug use.
The Task Force concluded that current detoxification and rehabilitation programs do not adequately provide for the specific needs of women.
psychologically of drug abuse, detoxification and rehabilitation is significantly different for women and men - Women seeking treatment often find themselves outnumbered by men in programs designed to meet the needs of men - Women often find the therapeutic environment hostile Consequently, the retention rate of women in mixed programs is often much lower than for men.
At present there are limited facilities exclusively available to women, although some programs have There is a clear need for services which target teenage girls and for counselling and education programs designed to assist girls before they become involved in the criminal justice system.
There is a need for services in both metropolitan and country centres for all drug users, and for local professionals to provide counselling and referral where specialist facilities do not exist.
abusers from entering a treatment program as most make no provision for children.
Treatment programs need to address broader issues such as sexual abuse and poor self-esteem, as well as focussing on drug abuse - women on drug-related offences should have access to life skills that provide alternatives to domestic Training for staff in drug and alcohol services needs to give attention to a number of issues of particular significance to drug dependent women including - under or overeating as a response to stress - use of drugs to achieve weight loss - relationship between narcotic use and anorexia esteem expressed in physical ways - effects of loss of custody on a mother - need to provide child care facilities for outpatient - the effects of social attitudes towards All agencies in the drug and alcohol field need to be encouraged to assess their success rate in attracting and retaining women in their programs.
Factors to be considered in assessment include - whether women are outnumbered and the effect this may have on women's level of participation - whether single sex groups should be conducted.
1.1 The use of mood-altering drugs prescribed legally in the course of routine consultations - medically condoned use - is more frequent among women of all ages than among men.
Women are more frequently numbered among long-term users of these drugs, specifically minor tranquillisers shows that the reasons for prescribing these drugs are most often anxiety, depression and insomnia.
Initiative can and should be directed to: wallowing
women to state their problems.
In the visibility of this problem and raised morale.
In Canada, posters were developed on the theme ''Silencing Women is not Helping Them''.
Breaking silence is in itself an important part of changing public attitudes; censuring

and assisting doctors in appropriate management of psychological problems of women; the problem of diversion of supplies obtained legally by women from doctors needs particular attention.
Doctors may be more aware of male addicts ''conning'' them and less aware that women may do the same.
1.2 Strategies for prevention, treatment and control of the excessive or inappropriate use of mood- altering drugs should take account of specific problems of women in relation to drug use and drug 1.3
The magnitude of the long-term task of controlling drug use and misuse should not distract policy makers at Federal and State levels from the practicalities of providing for women in need now, in the short-term, and ascertaining their needs 1.4 The use of mood altering drugs from illicit sources by women has highlighted particular the associations with prostitution and the problems faced by women addicts when the problems faced by women addicts in gaol and the problems faced by women addicts in drug treatment programs; the association between drug use and prostitution; is it one of cause and effect.
or are both activities related to underlying social factors, such as unemployment, or the problem of women being forced to leave their children behind to enter a drug 1.5 The context for social policy objectives The use and misuse of drugs by women and men is entrenched in our society.
Even in the long term, policy aimed at elimination is unlikely to succeed.
To be effective, policy must recognise the concept of relative risk of different kinds of drug use.
''A drug is not of itself good or bad, neither is the use of a drug automatically good or The risk entailed in the particular use of a particular drug depends on a combination of the characteristics of the person using the drug and the environment in which the person uses the drug.
All drugs which alter mood, whether obtained legally or illegally, can be detrimental to health and can be harmful to the community.
The converse is also true.
The means by which they are obtained is only one factor in determining the likely harm to the individual and to the 2.0 Patterns of Use of Drugs Drugs which alter mood are used in one or more of the following patterns, as outlined below in the excerpt from the Final Report of the SA Royal Commission into This is a single or short-term use, often by a young person, motivated primarily by curiosity or by a desire to experience new feelings or moods.
It most often occurs in the company of one or more school friends who are also experimenting.
It is the way in which schoolage children or adolescents try the effects of tobacco or alcohol or illegally used drugs, most commonly cannabis.
It is not, of course, only the young who experiment in this way.
Innovatory attitudes are encouraged throughout our society by natural curiosity, advertising, travel and the advent of new relationships.
Adults try out many things, including new drugs.
On the whole their experimentation (although they many not see it as such) is more likely to be with legally available tranquillisers, sedatives or appetite B. Social or Recreational Use Some of those who have experimented with a given drug will become experienced in using it.
They will then know what drug suits them and in what circumstances.
If they like the effects, and particularly if they like the group participatory element in what they are doing, they may decide to take it on social occasions when others are doing From the control point of view, an understanding of this recreational use of drugs has little to do with the legality or illegality of the behaviour.
A group of people sees the shared experience as agreeable and conventional within the group.
The use of the drug is voluntary and takes place only on those social occasions.
C. Circumstantial or Situational Drug Use There are other occasions where drugs are widely used, but still with the individual user in a position of choice and control.
There are situations where particular tasks have to be endurance or freedom from pain are sought - the student studying or being examined; the longs distance driver; the overwrought mother with young children; the business manager in competitive confrontations.
Other circumstances where drugs are commonly used to relieve stressful personal or social situations are those where shock, or loss have temporarily become too much to bear.
These are examples of occasions where sedatives, stimulants or tranquillisers are used by individuals who see them either as aids to the performance of difficult tasks required of them in their jobs or social roles, or as a means of coping with overwhelming emotion.
D. Intensified Drug Use This is not entirely a clear-cut category, but it centres on the use of drugs in major doses at least daily.
Such use borders on dependence, yet is similar to the previous category in that it is often related to an individual's need to achieve relief or to maintain a high level of performance.
Much depends upon the individual.
Examples are the heavily drinking businessman, the housewife taking large daily doses of tranquillisers or analgesics, and the young person who has turned to drugs as a source of meaning, excitement or escape in an unmanageable or unsupported adolescence.
E. Compulsive Drug Use producing psychological or physiological dependence such that the user cannot at will discontinue without experience significant mental or physical distress.
Compulsive users are preoccupied with their need to obtain adequate and sufficient amounts of the prevents them from playing a normal working or social role.
Alcohol and heroin are at present the drugs which cause most harm to the individual and to society through their compulsive use.
These five kinds of use carry different levels of risk.
For example, limited experimental use usually causes no physical harm and does not of itself induce dependence, but it is not entirely risk-free.
As we have already explained, some drugs have unpredictable effects, so that even a single try out can have serious or fatal effects.
It could impair the capacity to perform a skilled task such as operating industrial machinery, and this could be dangerous.
Moreover, for some individuals experimentation may be a prelude to deeper involvement with the use of drugs.
But on the whole the risk to individual users and to the community is small.
Social or recreational drug use generally remains under the user's control so that, provided doses are not rapidly increased, the risk of dependence is not great.
Personality and experience influence the outcome, as does the dependence-inducing potential of the drug or drugs.
Even with heroin, not all recreational users move on to intensified or compulsive use.
Nevertheless, recreational users of heroin may be dangerous to others since it is they (rather than the established addicts) who may introduce non-using acquaintances to this drug.
As for circumstantial use, a drug used in this way may have a beneficial effect where it enables an individual to cope with life experiences.
But chemical coping can become a habit, and judgment or performance may be impaired, creating the risk of harm to others.
Where the social supports reinforcing the individual's self- control break down, the risk of progression to more intensified use is greater.
Where a person begins to use a drug intensively or compulsively so that daily life is preoccupied with the drug, damage to health and to the community is more likely.
Prolonged high doses, which increase as tolerance to the drug develops, can produce addiction as well as functional or physical disorders depending on the drug or drugs used.
For example, alcohol taken in large quantities can produce coma as an acute response; but in the longer term heavy use can produce disease of the liver, heart, stomach and brain.
It can also affect the public safety, as it is shown by the preponderance of alcoholics in serious industrial and road accidents.
The heavy and sustained use of some compound analgesics may produce life-threatening kidney damage.
The way in which a particular drug is taken is important too.
Heroin, for example, has relatively few actions on organs other than the brain, but careless intravenous injection carries the risk of hepatitis, and septic or embolic heart and lung disease.
A preoccupation with obtaining and using a drug is often inconsistent with regular employment and the maintenance of stable relationships.
However, even compulsive use of drugs is not always incompatible with an otherwise dependent white-collar workers have been known to hide their dependence for many years and to continue professional and domestic life.
But if experimental or recreational use of drugs carries relatively few risks, intensified and compulsive use increases the chances of impairing the user's health and of inflicting damage on other members of the community.''

They and most other medical writers are confident that most users of prescribed drugs do so Nonetheless, anecdotal reports suggests that many women do experience physical withdrawal symptoms documented case reports of physical dependence and prolonged withdrawal symptoms from the use of these drugs in therapeutic doses.
3.4 Currently prescribing of psychotropic drugs by Australian doctors has stabilised, at least for prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits approximately 10.4 million prescriptions for prescribed under the PBS.
The reasons for the plateau are not certain.
First, they may be in part a result of changing amounts of patient contributions to the cost of a prescription, affecting in particular the PBS volume diazepam prescriptions.
Second, they may reflect a changing climate of public awareness which may be reflected in the doctor-patient relationship from which a prescription can flow.
Younger doctors have generally been found to prescribe fewer psychotropic drugs than their older counterparts, perhaps reflecting changed undergraduate teaching and attitudes with greater knowledge of non- pharmacological techniques for stress management.
3.5 The extent of use of heroin by women is not well documented.
The general impression is that this drug is less often used by women than men, in contrast to prescribed tranquillisers etc.
The NSW Women in Prisons' Task Force estimated that Thus the use of heroin is a particular problem in 3.6 Relevant sections of the Report of the NSW Task Force on Women in Prison which deal with women and drugs are summarised at Appendix A. 3.7 Reports of the experience of services provided specifically for drug dependent women are contained in Appendix B.

The drug most frequently used was heroin.
For the age group 20-24, the with 68% claiming to use heroin either alone or in conjunction with other drugs; 22.8% of these young women had ''use drugs' as one of the offences with which they were The Task Force was therefore concerned to develop recommendations for policy in relation to the disturbingly high proportion of women offenders in custody for drug and The Task Force considered it necessary to include a review and assessment of the following issues: (a) The adequacy and appropriateness of drug rehabilitation and detoxification facilities in New South Wales for women and, more particularly, for the profile of women presently in custody; and penalties in relation to drug use and abuse; c) The scope and efficacy of present procedures for diverting drug users from custody into appropriate which these procedures may be improved or extended; and for the population of drug-using and addicted women.
Drug use and abuse is primarily a health and social problem, most effectively dealt with by health and social agencies.
Drug dependence is chronic in nature and a drug-dependent individual will commonly seek many treatment options before she or he is able to control drug dependence.
The issue of drug dependency cannot be viewed in isolation but rather must be placed in a social, political and economic context.
Similarly, the criminal justice system and imprisonment must considered within such a context.
The conflict between the aims of drug rehabilitation and imprisonment The Task Force reached the conclusion that prison is an prison environment generates conditions which are in total contradiction to those designed to promote rehabilitation.
The requirements of security and of rehabilitation are in direct conflict.
They are inconsistent aims.
It is generally agreed that the aims of drug rehabilitration are: to promote the possibility of change and to open up a range of new life options; to promote a caring, supportive emphasize the benefits of a drug-free lifestyle in a information about drug use and to promote physical and future life options.
The prison environment reinforces because of poor nutrition and lack of exercise, fails to These effects of prison life and the attendant features of separation from friends and family promote general alienation and a mental and emotional outlook which constitutes the very attitudes and feelings which a drug-dependent woman needs to confront and overcome in order to break the self-destructive cycle of drug dependence.
Amongst the women interviewed for the Department of Corrective Services Profiling Study: ''Opinion was overwhelming that gaol is not a way of About half argued this was the case because no The remainder provided a wide range of other reasons to argue that gaol does not help addicts.''
To imprison such women at best reinforces existing negative attitudes and at worst causes them to deteriorate.
Thus, the likelihood of continuing drug use on release is increased (as the results of a Department of Corrective Services survey of The Task Force concluded that imprisonment for the great majority of women in NSW is an expensive and counterproductive exercise which causes a great deal of suffering to the drug-dependent individual.
It also perpetuates the cycle of homelessness, poverty and unemployment that so many women were caught up in prior to while the success rate of drug and alcohol services is difficult to define and measure, it is clear that prison is a failure as a response to drug-dependant women, that existing drug and alcohol services are not meeting women's needs, and that no genuine attempt has been made to initiate and fund services which target drug-dependent women who are being processed through the criminal justice system.
Profile of drug-dependent women in prison The majority of women in prison in NSW are young, working class and caught up in a cycle of poverty, unemployment and homelessness.
Being female and working class, they are at a double disadvantage in terms of educational and employment opportunities and, ultimately, in relation to the criminal There is a growing body of evidence that indicates a high correlation between a history of sexual abuse and drug dependency in women.
Many drug-dependent women may have sexual problems: for history; the use of sexuality to barter for the necessities of life and the effect of this on a woman's ability to identify her own sexual needs and desires.
The current rate of female teenage unemployment in New South The Task Force considers that services for drug-dependent women need to be directed not only to their drug use but also towards their needs for educational, vocational training, employment and counselling for sexual abuse.
Therefore, vocational training, educational programmes and employment schemes need to be developed in conjunction with Inadequacy of current treatment options for women Having examined the current range of detoxification and rehabilitation programmes available to drug users, the Task Force concluded that they do not adequately provide for the specific needs of women.
The Task Force considered that the subjective experience, both physiologically and psychologically, of drug abuse, detoxification and rehabilitation is significantly different for women and men.
Women who seek treatment at general detoxification and rehabilitation facilities often find themselves outnumbered by men (both staff and patients) in programmes designed to meet the needs of men.
With no adequate attention paid to the particular reality of drug-abusing women, women often find the therapeutic environment hostile or, at best, unresponsive to their needs.
Consequently, the retention rate of women in mixed programmes is often much lower than that noted for men in the same programmes.
(Of the 47 women interviewed as part of the Department of Corrective Services Profiling Study who have taken part in a rehabilitation programme, 72s said they did The Task Force sought information on drug programmes specifically designed to meet the needs of women in Victoria and in the United States.
The experiences of Pinaroo House Women's Programme in Victoria were detailed in an article written by two women who reasons for use are different, the nature of their use is different, their reasons for developing abuse are different, their reasons for seeking help are different, their experience in getting to help is different, their experience of the helping process is different, they develop control or abstinence for different reasons and in different ways, and they return to use for different acknowledged is testimony to the extent to which women's specific needs are suppressed and rendered ''Most of the women coming to treatment have extremely negative feelings about themselves.
Many of the women feel helpless, embarrassed, unattractive and worthless.
As well, many of the women have experienced broken marriages, distrust of relationships, physical, sexual and emotional abuse.
Accommodation, employment and finance pose major problems for most of the women.
''In the words of the women themselves, coming into a traditional male and female treatment setting means feeling nervous, scared, vulnerable and threatened.
It means not knowing where to go and A further analysis of the specific needs of drug-dependent women and attempts to meet these needs in the United States is documented in ''Special Features and Treatment Needs of female drug offenders enter treatment with a much greater feeling of powerlessness and corresponding helplessness to change their present condition than males do.
This sense of powerlessness is not delusory because few women, in fact, do occupy positions of authority or leadership in political, female drug offenders have usually been trained in such women have received no formal vocational training at all.
The results are that female drug offenders have often resorted to self-deprecating means of securing money for their habits.
Prostitution is but one example of such methods.
In effect, therefore, female drug abusers sacrifice far more of their personal freedom and standards than do male drug offenders.''
At present, there are only two facilities exclusively available to women in NSW.
A number of other programmes have acknowledged the particular needs of women by introducing There is an obvious need for services which target teenage girls.
At present only one agency identifies teenagers as part of its target client group.
Mulawa contains many young women who could well have been identified as having drug problems in their early teens.
There is a clear need for counselling and education programmes designed to assist teenage girls, many of whom may not yet be willing to undertake long-term rehabilitation.
Geographically, most detoxification and assessment services are located in the Sydney metropolitan area and so do not adequately service country regions.
On the other hand, many residential therapeutic communizes are located in isolated country areas, which makes access to urban dwellers difficult.
The Task Force accordingly considered that the Department of Health and the Drug and Alcohol Authority need area and country centres that would service all drug users, whether involved in the criminal justice system or not.
Where specialist facilities do not exist, local professionals should be co-ordinated to provide counselling and appropriate Most therapeutic communities will not accept children or couples.
This poses a considerable obstacle to women who ''Another sharp contrast between male and female drug abusers is found in the additional responsibility women have of trying to care for dependent children.
Children often make it impossible for female drug abusers to enter a therapeutic community that does not allow them to take their children with them.
In many instances, this restriction alone inhibits female drug abusers from seeking the treatment they require the heads of their own families, and they feel that they need to provide some type of support to their family units.
Men are typically not faced they are freer to enter treatment for a sustained Many rehabilitation programmes assume and encourage a very conservative, traditional view of women as domestic servants' and mothers.
Religious-based programmes often promote a abuse is often symptomatic of more fundamental problems such as sexual abuse and poor self-esteem, it is incumbent upon treatment programmes to address these broader issues as well as focussing on the drug abuse itself.
provides some useful insights: offenders must not utilize the humiliation tactics of traditional drug treatment programs to sensitize women to their errors, nor should it use menial, sexually stereotyped tasks as learning experiences.
Such negative reinforcement intensifies the self-hatred that women feel.
In the final analysis, therapeutic programs for female drug offenders must be based on an approach that goes beyond placing responsibility on the individual for her problems.
They should also focus on the social and political causes of female Drug use and abuse is often an understandable option for women who perceive no future for themselves in this society.
Many of the women currently in NSW prisons have rejected the traditional role of dependency on a male in a domestic have access to life skills that provide alternatives to domestic duties, prostitution and drug dealing.
The Task Force notes that there is a proportion of lesbian women incarcerated for drug and drug-related offences.
These women often perceive themselves as fiercely independent and react negatively to imposed authority.
The needs of such women are not adequately addressed by any of the currently existing rehabilitation programmes.
In fact, a clear indication of the inadequacy and inappropriateness of current treatment programmes is reflected in the findings of the Department's ''When asked to describe what they considered to be the effects of treatment on their drug use and temporary effect; for example 'It stopped me while I was there, but when I left I got back into it' One woman interviewed for the Department's Post-Release Survey had a three-stage theory of drug use: ''First there was the young girls who got into it mainly for the kicks, for something to do, didnt mind the work that when with it - in fact, liked the adrenalin rush of break and enter, and were still young enough to crack it on the streets.
Then there was the older crowd who relied they had a habit but could still turn a trick or had a partner who sometimes supplied their drugs.
If you survivied this era, you became an older junkie who was bored with the hard work involved with keeping a serious habit going, bored with going to gaol.
It was then that you were likely to just She said she didnt know any women addicts who were over Significant issues for staff training in drug and alcohol services There are a number of issues of particular significance to women prisoners who are drug dependent.
Insufficient attention is given to these issues in the training of staff.
These include undereating or overeating as a response to stress; use of drugs to achieve weight loss; the relationship Health issues need to be recognized: for example, menstrual tension and libido levels in the early days of a drug-free life.
The effects of loss of custody on a mother need to be recognized.
The need to provide child-care facilities to enable the mother more readily to participate in outpatient and inpatient services, and the broader issue of the effects of widespread popular attitudes towards a drug-dependent woman, are issues which need to be addressed.
The need for evaluation of existing services All agencies in the drug and alcohol field need to be encouraged to assess their success rate in attracting and retaining women in their programmes.
Some factors which need to be considered in making this assessment are whether women are outnumbered in the programme and if so, the effect this may have on a woman's level of participation, and whether single sex groups should be conducted within existing RECOMMENDATIONS R. That entry to all treatment programmes should be R.
That staff training programmes be developed to explore issues of particular concern to drug-dependent women and which target the special needs of women caught up in the criminal justice system.
Staff in all agencies who have contact with drug-dependent women should have access to R. That drug and alcohol agencies be encouraged to assess their degree of success in attracting and retaining women and to develop procedures and mechanisms to improve their success rate.
That a drug rehabilitation service be established which is designed to meet the needs of the young, working class, drug-dependent women who make up the bulk of the current female prison population in this State.
While the Task Force sees the necessity for all drug and alcohol agencies to assess and improve their effectiveness with female drug offenders, it also sees the need for an agency which tailors its services directly to the needs of female offenders.
The limited acceptance by some agencies of women on probation or on bail is an area of particular concern.
The Task Force recommends that this service should: a day programme.
Day programmes are recommended, given the difficulty many women with schoolage children have in attending a residential centre.

It has a stabilisation program of methadone as it has been found that the earlier in the pregnancy methadone is used, the better the results for the pregnancy.
Babies of narcotic addicted women suffer from growth retardation and prematurity, but not malformations as with alcoholic women.
Late miscarriages are common for heroin addicts sudden infant death syndrome.
Problems accommodation.
No homes caring for mothers and babies will take women on methadone.
Most women leave their original areas and come to the inner city where they have no contacts, are isolated, and without family support.
The unit has funding for Phoebe House, which will be a halfway house and therapeutic community for pregnant women, and young babies of narcotic addicts who must be on a methadone program.
Women will stay 3-6 months and then be assisted in setting up home.
This is a major problem for pregnant women because they have to travel daily to a dispensing centre.
The unit at the hospital is meant to serve only the inner metropolitan and southern regions, but people travel from other areas because so many dispensing centres have shut down.
Many women would have tc travel by several buses and with long walks to get to the dispensing centre.
This is very difficult for pregnant women and those with young babies.
When they are discharged from the hospital they are referred to the Bourke Street Drug and Alcohol Centre which involves walking through Kings Cross and being exposed to addicts.
The centre is only makes it even more difficult if travelling long Addicts cannot be given more doses of methadone to take away to avoid having to come daily, because they are likely to sell it.
very difficult to counsel women addicts, as it is more than likely that their partner is also an addict and the woman may support his habit by prostitution, or she may inject him herself.
Family dynamics cannot be used for treatment.
What is needed is some way to assess the family unit together.
Two-thirds of women would be in a relationship when they go onto a methadone program or dry out.
This can cause problems in the relationship - the man may be dependent on the woman to support his habit, and she may find she has nothing in common with him except their drug habit.
Often she has to choose between the baby and the recognition of their specific needs and problems rather than expecting them to come inc (5) There is very little awareness of the danger of acute withdrawal, especially for women near full against her, including other addicts and police.
