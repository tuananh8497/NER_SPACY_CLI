Purpose.
To establish a continuing Mercury Control Safety Program for dental facilities which will eliminate hazardous practices in mercury handling and storage.
3. Background.
Current studies indicate that the principal mercry hazard in environments such as dental operatories is the cumulative effect of mercry on the body acquired by continuous inhalation of mer- cry vapors and by direct contact with mercry contaminated equipment and materials.
Additionally, surveys of dental facilities conducted at national and state levels have revealed mercury vapor concentrations in excess of acceptable standards.
The use of mercury in the dental office may be potentially hazardous to the health of the dentist and dental auxiliary personnel if sufficient safety precautions are not taken in the handling of mercury.
Mercury is also of environmental concern since it has been designated a toxic environmental pollutant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Once mercury enters the body, it tends exposure results in central nervous system disorders, severe psychic late matter such as waste amalgam may be inhaled from the atmosphere.
Mercury may be ingested by eating with contaminated fingernails, or by smoking in the work area.
Mercury droplets may also be absorbed either through direct contact with intact skin or through breaks in the skin such as cuts and abrasions.
The danger of excessive contamination is much greater in confined areas.
A room with good air circulation but no ventilation offers no more protection than one filled with stagnant air.
The fact that mercury vapors are odorless and seldom detected by the human senses compounds the safety problem.
Mercury contamination in dental offices usually originates from spills in handling, leakage from capsules in trituration and mulling procedures, and from the evacuation of amalgam and free mercury during condensation and carving of restora- tins.
Improper storage of scrap mercury and amalgam may contribute to mercury contamination.
Reliable studies reflect the fact that the mercury hygiene observed by dental personnel is the determining factor in influ- fencing mercury vapor levels in dental offices.
Careless handling of mercury or improper storage can result in an accumulation of spilled mercury on table tops, in drawers, and on floors, setting the stage for hazardous mercury vapor concentrations.
reulrements of reference (a) so that the practice of dentistry is not inhibited.
However, certain uniform controls throughout ships are needed to ensure that ships' equipment does not become contaminated by mercury and to ensure that mercury waste disposal is properly control personnel exposures to mercury and monitor the effectiveness (5) shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in maintaining MERCURY HYGIENE PREVENTIVE MEASURES 1. Alert all personnel involved in handling mercury, especially during training or indoctrination periods, of the potential hazard of mercury vapor and the necessity for observing good mercury-hygiene practices.
Before working with mercury, all personnel should remove jewelry such as air exchange and outside exhaust.
Any filters placed in line, such as air-conditioning filters, may act as mercury reservoirs and should be 3. Since the prime source of mercury exposure to the dental team is atmospheric mercury, monitoring of the dental office area is the first step in mercury surveys.
Monitoring and record keeping will be carried 4. Strict boundary control should be maintained in those dental spaces where dental personnel carry out mixing procedures and laboratory functions in which mercury is handled.
The primary purpose of this control is to prevent access and needless mercury exposure of nondental personnel and material.
forth this requirement for dental spaces afloat.
Floors of operatories where mercury is used shall be swabbed with mercury decontamination (Hg) solution every 30 days and more often when the mercury vapor analyzer 6. Store mercury in unbreakable, tightly sealed containers away from any 7. Confine the use of mercury to areas that have impervious and suitably lipped surfaces to confine and facilitate recovery of spilled mercury or excess amalgam.
Transfer mercury from bottle to dispenser and trituration capsule over a catch tray.
8. Use tightly closed capsules during amalgamation.
The tightness of new or used capsules can be checked by wrapping adhesive tape around the capsule.
The adhesive will tend to hold the top of screw cap capsules in place.
Therefore, attach the adhesive to the capsule so that it flares out across the capsule junction and around the cap.
A leak will show up as little drops of mercury on the adhesive tape after vibration in a mechanical amalgamator.
One technique of decreasing leakage from screw- top capsules is the addition of a rubber ''O'' ring between the two sections to act as a gasket.
from the mouth when working with mercury and wash hands thoroughly as soon as possible after completion of mixing procedures.
Never mull amalgam in the hand.
To alleviate the necessity of squeezing the mass If the amalgam or mercury, or both, must be handled, nonporous gloves should be worn.
Also, exposed skin should be cleansed frequently.
Any disposable materials contaminated with mercury or amalgam should be placed in a polyethylene bag and sealed before disposal.
less steel catch tray.
It is recommended, where possible, to place the tray on top of an operators cabinet instead of inside ''Alabama'' style cabinetry where stray mercury droplets are difficult to retrieve.
If space permits, store the scrap amalgam container in the catch tray.
Otherwise, the scrap amalgam container is to be located to the rear of counter tops or in a protected area to prevent accidental spillage.
Although all types of amalgam condensation give off some mercury vapor, studies have shown that mercury vapor and droplet formation are greatest with ultrasonic amalgam condensers.
Therefore, ultrasonic condensers should not be used.
Use water spray and high-volume evacuation when removing old or finishing new dental amalgam restorations.
Exhaust systems that empty air into the operators should be fitted with a mercury filter.
Use a face mask to avoid breathing amalgam dust.
Salvage all amalgam scrap mercury or mercury bearing wastes (excluding those traces of amalgam waste that drain through the dental unit cuspidors) and store it in a tightly closed and labeled stainless steel jar containing mercury ''X' solution in a sufficient quantity to cover the collected mass vide requirements for proper disposition of mercury and mercury bearing wastes so that mercury waste is packaged in double plastic wraps, or polyethylene bottles and labeled for disposal.
This enables nondental personnel to identify the nature of the waste.
such as mercury containing antiseptics.
It is desirable to use an amalgamator with completely enclosed arms and amalgam capsule during amalgamation.
Handle the mercury dispenser with care and periodically check for leakage.
Some dispensers leak mercury spontaneously.
Examine the mercury dispenser orifice after use for residual mercury.
Any mercury droplets remaining should be disposed of as described in cracks, and depressions in floor covering where mercury may collect and remove all visible mercury contamination.
os MONITORING AND RECORD KEEPING FOR MERCURY HYGIENE 1.
At least once each 12 months, the air in spaces where mercury is used or stored shall be tested to determine the concentration of mercury vapor.
These tests shall include breathing zone samples and other environmental irate, in monitoring personnel exposure levels shall be obtained from industrial hygiene personnel located at bummed activities listed in enclo- 2. In spaces where personnel may be or are exposed to mercury vapor levels date action shall be taken to reduce or minimize further personnel expos suers.
At no point in time shall the mercury vapor level in the air be allowed to exceed O.lmg/M.
Environmental samples shall be taken to evaluate the effectiveness of corrective actions.
3. A first morning urine specimen of all dental personnel exposed to mercury vapor shall be obtained when 24-hour specimens are not available, and analyzed for mercury at least annually; and on a quarterly basis if there is any question regarding the adequacy of environmental controls.
The commanding officer/officer in charge shall keep a summary record of environmental and biological monitoring and evaluate hazards to health and the effectiveness of preventive measures.
The dental officer in charge of each Navy dental facility or department will conduct an annual audit of dental spaces where mercury is stored or handled to determine that proper storage, handling, and disposition of mercury and mercury products are routinely followed.
This audit should provide assurance that mercury bearing materials are not being mishandled.
CLEAN-UP OF MERCURY SPILLS 1.
When a small amount of mercury is spilled, clean it up promptly.
Use neoprene gloves to protect the hands and carefully gather up as many mer- and corners with an eye dropper or by attaching a glass tube with a small inside diameter to a rubber tubing and connecting it to a good vacuum source with a water trap to collect mercury.
2. Use only vacuum cleaners specially designed for cleanup of mercury spills such as the Mer -Vac.
Ordinary vacuum cleaners tend to heat and spread mercury vapors, thus increasing office atmospheric levels.
3. It is virtually impossible to decontaminate carpeting following a major spill.
Carpeting is no longer approved for installation in naval dental facilities except in administrative spaces and waiting areas.
Dispose of contaminated carpeting and mats which cannot be purged of 4. The use of mercury decontaminant is especially recommended to lower the mercury vapor concentration resulting from a mercury spill.
One type mercury-sulfide converting powder combined with a chelating compound and (19.0L), and applied as a spray or wash to the affected spaces.
The floors of rooms in which mercury is used should be made of a smooth, seamless material which can be wet down and kept scrupulously clean.
If the floor has deep cracks and crevices, Hg may be mixed with sawdust and distributed with a mop to help neutralize entrapped or hidden contaminated areas.
The sawdust/Hgk mixture should be swept up or vacuumed after it has been in place overnight.
A pail full of Hg and saturated sawdust mixture may be kept on hand to decontaminate mercury spills as soon as they occur.
Another equally effective mixture can be prepared by mixing one part of precipitated sulfur (sulfur flowers) to five parts of finely ground, wetted sawdust.
Mixtures containing calcium sulfide or calcium polys sulfide are also used, but they possess an objectionable odor.
MERCURY CONTROL SAFETY PROGRAM MATERIALS The following materials shall be utilized in Mercury Control Safety Program.
These materials with the exception of the Mersorb cartridge filter, Part M76886, are standard stock items and may be requisitioned through the Navy Supply System.
The Mersorb cartridge filter may be procured from the following source: Mine Safety Appliances Co. SAFETY MANAGER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE consultation and specific assistance in monitoring personnel exposure levels through the collection and reading of air and blood or urine samples.

At my last visit to ur office I indicated briefly the purpose of our functional index which divides six thousand forms into over seventy broad categories.
The use of the prefix PM for Personnel Medical was sped by both Air and Navy and was most appropriate at the time.
The use of the prefix PHS for Personnel Health Services would not seriously inconvenience the Forms Section.
It would also have the advantage of placing the joint medical forms in a category by themselves.
We therefore agree to your suggestion using PHs as a prefix to your new series of forms.

I advised you that the available evidence was under active consideration, and I have now received a report from the Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee.
The three original papered published in the Lancet of 21 September 197 were examined, together with the Lancet editorial of the same date, other related references, and the criticism by Professor The association between carcinoma of the breast and the use of rauwolfia derivatives detected by the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program was also found in surveys from the United Kingdom and Finland.
The fact that the association was shown in three different sets of data enhances the likelihood of a causal relationship.
The inherent limitations in the methodology of the studies have been recognised, but no source of bias has been postulated which would selectively affect rauwolfia and its derivatives to a greater extent than other antihypertensive drugs for which no association with carcinoma of the breast has been demonstrated.
It has been calculated that a cohort study which might produce a more clear-cut answer is impracticable because of the large numbers With the above reservations, the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee does not recommend the withdrawal of rauwolfia derivatives.
It considers continued surveillance necessary and suggests that medical practitioners should review the role of rauwolfia in the antihypertensive regimen of individual patients since alternative drugs are available.

sa fE PHARMACEUTICAL EENEFITS ADVISORY COMMITTEE The purpose of this letter is to keep you informed of reasons for some changes to the list of pharmaceutical benefits as a result of recommendations made by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to the Minister for Health and also a reminder about the availability of increased quantities of benefit items in certain circumstances.
The specific matters referred to hereunder are - (i) the deletion of methaqualone tablets and capsules from the Schedule of Benefits as from 1 December: and repeats for phenoxymethylpenicillin and phenethicillin tablets and capsules as from benefit items for the treatment of a chronic condition or where unusually large amounts of a benefit are needed.
The Committee has recommended the deletion from the hypnotic which is subject to abuse due to its significant hallucinogenic properties.
It has already been transferred to Schedule 6 (drugs of addiction) of the Uniform Poisons Schedules of the National Health and Medical Research Council and s already classified as a Schedule 8 drug in Queensland an Reports from the World Health Organisation indicate that methaqualone abuse in the U.S.A. and Europe is entering a new and particularly dangerous stage; concern has also been expressed at the increasing incidence of methaqualone abuse, particularly in conjunction with the ingestion of alcohol, in some Asian countries.
The Committee considers that there are sufficient tarnative drugs available as benefits to meet present patient the Schedule of Benefits will take effect from december 97.
You will have noted that in the 4 August edition of the Schedule of Benefits phenoxymethylpenicillin and phenethicillin in the form of tablets and Capsules i25mg and 29omg continue to be available as unrestricted pharmaceutical benefits (for the or capsules and no repeats) and are now also concurrently listed for this purpose only is 50 tablets or capsules with provision for up to 5 repeats (ie.
differential maximum quantities and repeats for the one drug depending on its intended use).
The Committee had, for some time, been examining ways and means of minimising the number of situations in which there is a requirer meant to obtain an authority to prescribe certain benefit items or additional quantities of benefit items.
The way has only recently become clear to enable two different but concurrent listings for the one benefit item; the Committee sees this as a positive step in significantly reducing the number of applications which doctors would normally have to submit for authority to prescribe in relation to benefit items where the differential listings can specifically be made.
The Minister for Health and his Department have been pleased to try this new System of differential listings for these preparations.
The Committee has in mind to extend this type of listing to certain other appropriate drug groups for example, tetracyclines for severe acne or chronic bronchitis; certain antihistamines which are also used for prevention of migraine.
The Committee will be guided by the medical profession's acceptance and strict observance of the restrictions for the differential quantities of the penicillin preparations in assessing such listings and in recommending extensions to other drug groups.
However, if the prescribing of the relevant benefit items indicates that the restrictions relating to differential listing are not being observed, the Committee would be forced to abandon the concept of differential quantities and recommend return to an authority system.
The Committee has received a significant number of representations from medical practitioners requesting increases in the maximum quantities or repeats shown in the Schedules of Benefits for particular items.
As a result the Committee feels that some doctors may not be conversant with the provisions at heist for the prescribing of increased maximum quantities or repeats of pharmaceutical benefits.
These provisions are set out in the explanatory notes (Section i, paragraphs 17 and authority of the Director of Health in the State concerned, may preserve a pharmaceutical benefit in a quantity greater than the listed maximum qquantity where - (i) the patient is suffering from a chronic (ii) when it is desirable that the patient be not obliged to revisithis doctor in order to secure repeat supplies.

a la A Headquarters Support Command RAAF Chancery House The terms of the enclosed letter are to be conveyed to all appropriate unit medical staff as a matter of priority.
Squadron Leader For Air Officer Commanding A We have received a report from the U.K. on a small number of patients on long term treatment with ractolol who have developed a psoOriasislike rash and a proportion of these patients have exhibited ocular changes.
This report originated at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.
The rash is characterised by a thickening of the skin of the psalms and soles with atypical peoriasis-like plaques over the knees and gyrate lesions on other areas of the body.
The rash clears within a few weeks on withdrawal of practolol.
In eight patients, gather with seven patients still under investigations, ocular changes have been seen in association with the rash.
The eye symptoms have developed with or have followed the appearance of the skin eruption.
The eye changes consist of an impairment of tear flow leading to a dry eye, irritation and redness.
This has progressed to a conjunctival scarring and in two patients the cornea has been involved.
During this period treatment with practolol continued as an association had not been suspected.
The onset of the eye changes occurred are being investigated and have been discussed with the Committee On Safety of medicines in the UK; the Comonwesalth Department of Health has been notified in Australia.
The picture will become clearer when the present investigation has been conducted.
Should any patient receiving practolol exhibit or develop skin or eye lesions he or she should be withdrawn from treatment with There have been other findings in some of these patients but their relationship to practolol administration is not clear at the present time.
Some of the patients developed some hearing loss and complained of tinnitus but they received no otological examination.
It is suggested that should such symptoms develop in patients on practolol then a detailed examination should be carried out and treatment should be discontinued until the situation is clarified.
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Reports of such reactions should be sent to The Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee of the Commonwealth Department of Health and we would be grateful to receive a copy of any such report for our ow records.
Yours faithfully RA A a Medical Services Division HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS The terms of the enclosed letter are to be conveyed to all appropriate unit medical staff as a matter of priority.
Squadron leader For Air Officer Commanding aN IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC CAUTION As a result of publications in the Lancet, the Medical Journal of Australia, the Prescribers' Journal and recently even in the lay press you are probably ayare that clonidine hydrochloride has been reported to be of value in the prophylaxis of migraine.
The dosage recommended in the United Kingdom for this indication is much lower than than that required for the treatment of hypertension.
For this reason in the United Kingdom a 25 microgram tablet of introduced in Australia nearly 2 years ago for the treatment of.
It has become apparent that some doctors are trying clonidine Hydrochloride for migraine and are doing so by halving or advantages.
It is impossible to get exactly one quarter of the active ingredient by quartering a tablet, so dosage is at best imprecise.
To use half a tablet of Catapres twice daily exposes the patient immediately to the maximum dosage recommended in the United Kingdom for the prophvladis of migraine.
This cold result in the occurrence of side effects in some persons (unwanted lowering of blood pressures initial sedation and dryness of the mouth) which might not have appeared had a gradual increase from the correct starting dose been employed.
Lastly there is some evidence that a low initial dose is particularly important in the prophylaxis of migraine because some patients in whom the incidence and severity of attacks can be shown to improve on low doses may fail to respond to higher dosage.
For these reasons would you please reserve Catapres for the treatment of hypertension and wait until a 25 microgram tablet becomes available before assessing clonidine hydrochloride for the prophylaxis of An application for marketing approval for the use of clonidine for the prophylaxis of migraine has been submitted to the Department of Health and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee.
When approval has been given, everything will be done to make the lower strength formulation available for your use as soon as possible.
