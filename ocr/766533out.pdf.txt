The Committee particularly stated that the instruments of espionage were not ''Any form of sympathy or compulsion that can be laid hold of will serve its turn and among these compulsions fear, and his subsequent confession of having bon co arced to spy against the United Ningdom as a direct result of having ebon photographed in The Tribunal appointed to inquire into the vassal case (which to and then cultivated by Russian agents an his vanity summer of 1955 had ebon brought into subjection to the control of the hostile Secrot Service by a mirage of menaces, Services responsible for intolligence activities both within and beyond the Soviet Union, employs a group of homosexuals for the empress purpose of compromising Westerners whom they consider to be potentially useful have devised policies and procedures to deal with homosemuality in relation to security status.

Froma the erperience of the Canadians it appears that when confronted with proof endemic in such persons tends to make the somewhat frank in disclosing the identities of persons with whom they have, in the past, been involved.
a Imadeuacy of existing procedures In conformity with foisting procedures the Director Gemeral of Security, in advising Departments or other agencies upon the security status of persons proposed for access to classified information bases his reports upon the results of cheering against security intelligence Where, in the course of such checking, information of serious character defects emerges, appropriate advice on thosc aspects is reported to the employing Department to initiate separately its own character checking (through Commonwealth Police Force if no departmental facility is available) the Director General of Security is not necessarily aware of adverse character reports.
Moreover, it is not the practice of Departments to inform the Director -General of averse reports, as to the character of a person submitted for security checking which may be known to the Department at the tine the check is submitted, or subsequently received.
In view of the close relation which hs now developed beteen attributes to pressure by foreign intelligence services it is considered that such attributes not only require consideration as matters affectins security status, but that they constitute a most serious irk to the It is also to be noted that the security risks which derive from the employment of honosemls in positions of accedas to classified information tend to be aggravated by the disposition of such persons to For the purposes of this submission the socurity risks which women who are addicted to such similar practices.

Furthermore, neither the Permanent Head of a Department nor the Public Service Board is bound to accept the advice of the Directors General of Security in relation to an officer considered by him to constitute a security risk.
The occasion may arise when either the Permanent Head or the Bcard or both, proceeding in the utmost good faith, may hesitate to risk damaging the reputatin of an officer by taking a part in the effecting of his transfer without there being proof of activity prejudicial As it is y belief that the employment in any capacity by the Commonwealth of communists and communist or to the defence of the Commonwealth, and bearing in mind the tin as to whether I should submit that actin should be taken to establish a ''purge procedure' in relatin to employment by the Commonwealth.
