Such vital issues as the following require to be demonstrated: (a) the criteria of successful administrative and utilised by the drug dependent population.
Solutions can only be expected if ae strict monitoring system is incorporated at the outset.
It would not be necessary, and indeed would be unwise, to build an organisation entirely separate from and unrelated to the comprehensive mental health services now being developed.
Although some special services will be needed, many of the constituent modalities required are already in existence and will require minimal expansion to encompass the management of the drug dependent Although from available data it is obvious that the need for action in the field of drug dependence appears to have become urgent, any estimate of actual incidence and prevalence is speculative and subjective.
If adequate programmes are to be mounted and, perhaps even more important, their efficiency is to be gauged, accurate incidence and prevalence data are essential.
One advantage of a non-legalistic approach to the drug dependent person would be the possibility of compulsory notification to health authorities.
Action has been taken by the Mental Health Committee to convene a Working Party to devise a system of recording data and the advisability of compulsory notification is to be considered by the Working National Archives of Australia recording and recall of data will have to be devised.
This data collection must incorporate statistics from all agencies concerned with those who abuse drugs.
The statistics collected by established health agencies represent only one highly selected portion of the whole.
lack the preciseness of definition essential to objective Staff occupying key positions must be carefully selected and trained.
The basic attitude and expectations of the care-giver are known to have a bearing on the outcome of management.
As long as staff reflect authoritarian and rejecting community attitudes, perpetuation of the present frustrating situation must be expected.
Prior to inauguration of services it will be necessary to provide training programmes paying particular attention not only to the content of the courses but also to the methodology Although there is a growing body of information concerning all aspects of drug dependency, there is a significant hiatus regarding the local scene.
It would, therefore, be essential that some of the professional workers in the.

In the prison medical services some duplication of certain of these elements will be necessary for those drug dependent persons who have been apprehended for commission of offences.

admitted for periods of up to four weeks if necessary, for a thorough examination of all relevant aspects or their problem and the formulation of a realistic longs term management plan.
Opinions vary as to the extent to which detoxification centres should be provided and as to whether alcoholic and other drug dependent persons should be treated together.
The provision of detoxification for alcoholics involves a substantial change in social policy and the transfer of a considerable case load from the police to a medical care ness can total several hundred each night and policy decisions will be required as to how many of such persons should be taken to a detoxification centre.
National Archives of Australia For drug dependent persons other than alcoholics, medically addicted person frequently finds it difficult to gain admission to both general and psychiatric hospitals once the fact of his addiction is revealed and he is in fear of seeking treatment with its concomitant risk of legal sanctions being invoked.
Arrangements are required whereby immediate admission is available for drug dependent persons without prejudice, without rejection as a recurrent phenomenon and without fear of legal sanctions being imposed.
Such centres could be established in a variety of settings amongst which could be an independent drug treatment centre, a general hospital or a mental hospital.
The essential feature is that the unit be able to establish an admission policy independent of any larger parent organisation.
The institutional atmosphere of such centres should be minimised.
The failure to control addiction in the United States of America is eloquent testimony to the inability of conventional medical and psychiatric practice to cope with this problem.
The common error has been to regard drug dependence as a single problem for which a single treatment can be found.
undoubtedly some drug dependent persons are managed well by conventional techniques but a far greater number are not.
The legalistic approach which punishes and confines the addict on the basis of a naive negative conditioning theory reinforced by abstinence has been equally ineffective.
Such policies are often given expression will attest to the failure of this system where even within the institution a drug-free environment could not For these reasons an eclectic approach is advocated.
This eclecticism must, however, go well beyond the traditional boundaries of psychiatry.
The elements of a comprehensive eyetem are set out.
The established mental health care system is able to absorb a number of patients assessed as requiring conventional treatment.
No separate facility is advocated but placements should be facilitated by close communication between the National Archives of Australia Certain addicted persons appear to do well in the House.
Very difficult problems surround the management of such units within the mental hospital system and much therapeutic energy can be diverted into solving problems of relationship with the parent system.
It is also difficult if not impossible, to overcome the problem of attitude inherent in staff, particularly nurses who are identified with conventional treatment systems.
For these reasons we advocate the establishment of such units under psychiatric direction but outside the mental hospital and general hospital systems.
We also advocate staffing by applicants specially selected and trained.
We recognise the difficulties inherent in administering small separate units, but consider the therapeutic advantages outweigh the In addition to the psychiatrically orientated there has been a measure of observed success with self-governing therapeutic communities with the emphasis on individual and group responsibility Psychiatrists generally are concerned at the lack of controls inherent in such systems but in the absence of evidence that these systems do any harm and in the present failure situation some experimentation in this direction is advocated.
These systems may be established best by voluntary organisations, with government support where In all forms of therapeutic community treatment the administering authorities must be prepared to accept criticism and ridicule.
It is not possible to run such units without some addicted people taking drugs, some depressed people committing suicide and some promiscuous people behaving and rrimarv Contact Centres A typical programmes quite different from conventional services and perhaps regarded as alien to present adult community value judgments need to be considered.
Service personnel are required to at least accept the life style of the clientele and avoid moralising, and insisting on conformity to middle-class values in relation to work, sexual propriety, religious concepts and the like.
National Archives of Australia Strategically placed first line facilities in areas such as the city centre where dropouts can gather, where empathic professional help is available to discuss problems and where crises can at least be examined are needed.
Voluntary organisations with professional consultation and employing some minimal professional staff would appear most suited to manage such centres.
Mental Health Consultation CQDUltY Organisation and Services to IOutr The provision of health education programmes is not commented on as this has already been the subject of full discussion and action arising out of the Commonwealth grant for this purpose.
It has become apparent however, that it is difficult and undesirable to separate health education entirely from service programmes to youth and community organisations.
Greater flexibility and additional finance is required to allow assistance to be offered directly by the State and by way of subsidy to voluntary organisations in the field of Community Organisation and Youth Counselling These centres are designed to provide a non medically oriented advisory and counselling service for young people and their parents.
Thus far the programmes have been restricted to promoting part-time centres staffed by counsellors employed by the State Association for Mental Health on a sessional basis.
As a further step the establishment of permanent The creation of positions is proposed for ''Youth Programme Organisers'' whose task would be by way of commnity organisation to promote programmes at the local community level 'designed to offer young people effective alternatives to involvement in the various deviant subcultures including drug abuse''.

In view of the fact that drug offenders can be dealt with under existing taste Legislation, it is not clear wily the therefore, if you would indicate why the move to amend the Customs Act pus initiated and ir what way the Government regarded existing Staste legislation as inadequate.

riding importance in the consideration of all social or political action directed against the drug problem.
In the public and private debates which take place on this problem, most people are inclined to disregard those arguments which do not accord with their own prejudices.
Even when a completely uncommitted approach is taken to the problem, it is very difficult to arrive at a correct conclusion as to the relative importance of the various causes of the increasing drug problem and the effects of the various measures proposed to I shall take a simple example.
le recent amendments to the Customs Act have been criticised as emphasising the punitive approach at the expense of other measures, such as education.
On the other hand those who have criticized the Covern- sanctions do have some deterrent effect.
It appears to me therefore, that we will never find a solution to the drug problem whilst we rely on the seat of our pants in determining what action we will take.
For this reason, I have been exercising my mind for some time on the feasibility of using a computer model to determine the dynamic effects, upon each other, of various anti-drug measures.
I have been in touch personally computer models of various social systems, and has sent me a systems simulation of ''Narcotics and the Community'', a study undertaken at the structing the model has been gathered from a variety of sources, National Archives of Australia I am not suggesting that this model is a panacea but it has, I believe, important implications.

However, I believe, that an adequate approach to the drug problem is impossible without the implementation of a systems analysis.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM STATES .
New South Wales Methadone maintenance has been undertaken in a number of patients in this State on a trial basis.
It has been found necessary to maintain strict control over the use of methadone in these programmes and this has been exercised by the Director-General of Public Health through his powers under Section 28 of the Poisons Act 1966.
It is a condition of the issue of an authority to prescribe methadone that each patient presents daily to take his dose under supervision.
Where the patient wishes to travel anywhere that is not within reach of one of the established units, a supply of up to three days requirements at one time may be authorised.
When a patient wishes to go interstate or overseas, prior arrangements must be made for supervision of his This State considers that it is necessary that methadone maintenance patient programmes should be closely supervised psychiatrically and that their medication should be dispensed daily and taken only under direct supervision.
In accordance with the drug programme in Queensland at the present time, patients would be required to present at a Public Hospital for their methadone.
Methadone is a narcotic drug in this State and may only be supplied by or on the prescription of a medical practitioner registered in South Australia In this State the matter is currently under consideration.
In commenting on a Departmental inquiry concerning persons entering the country while on methadone maintenance programmes, the Western Australian Department of Public Health indicated that there was little or nc heroin addiction in the State.
They do not think it justifiable to jeopardise this state of affairs by giving permission to known addicts to enter the country while their rehabilitation is still in the precarious area of methadone substitution National Archives of Australia The current policy is to treat each case on its merits.
It is not considered that methadone maintenance in high dosage on an indefinite basis is a desirably mthcd of treatment at this stage.
The matter is being kept under review and once facilities have been established persons on a methadone maintenance regime will be treated on a conservative basis.
Natonal Archives of Australia Statistics of Psychotropic Substances Under the Psychotropic Substances Convention Australia is required to furnish to the International Narcotics Control Board the following statistics relating to psychotropic substances for each calendar Schedule Substances Schedule II Substances Schedule IV Substances Figures for stocks as at 3 December each year to be supplied by State Health authorities in respect of Schedule I and Schedule II substances Manufacturers of psychotropic substances will be licensed by the Health authorities.
These authorities will be responsible for ensuring adequate controls and providing details of statistics of manufacture.
Note that the term manufacture also includes the making of preparations other than those made on prescription in pharmacies.
The preparations concerned would be only those not covered by the procedure set out in the following section.
National Archives of Australia Article 3 of the Convention provides for the partial exemption of preparations if they are compounded in such a way that they: (a) present no or a negligible risk of abuse; so that the preparation does not give rise to a public health and social Health authorities will be required to provide statistics of the quantity of substances used in the manufacture of these preparations, but it will not be necessary to provide statistics of quantities of these In order to avail themselves of the exemption provisions, parties will be required to forward to the Secretary-General the name and composition of each preparation which they propose to exempt.
It is obviously in the interest of a government to prepare the list of exemptions before becoming a party to the Convention so that they can be furnished to the Secretary-General at the time of ratification.
The preparation of such a list of exemptions would perhaps be most appropriately undertaken by the Poisons Schedule Advisory Committee of quantity Used in the Manufacture of non-psvchotropic substances Article 4 provides for the use of psychotropic substances in industry for the manufacture of non-psychotropic substances or products.
Such psychotropic substances are still subject to control whilst they are in a condition where they could be abused or recovered.
State Health authorities will be required to supply statistics of quantities of psychotropic substances so utilised.
These figures will be provided by Customs.
The International Narcotics Control Board has already requested the above statistics for the year 1971.
It is proposed to provide those import and export statistics which are available and advise that other in formation is not available for the year 1971.
It is hoped that State Health authorities will be in a position to provide all the above statistics in respect of the current year.
At the present time it is considered that the wording of the Psychotropic Substances Convention is such that it does not include the salts and esters of the substances listed in the four schedules.
This aspect is currently being followed up with the United Nations.
In the meantime, it is considered that Australia should exercise similar controls over the salts and ethers as it does over the substances i Specialist Training for Drug Investigators At its meeting on 3.4.70 the Committee agreed that there was merit in the proposal to have a centralised training course for all drug investigators.
Subsequently training courses were conducted by Customs and the Commonwealth Police.
To avoid overlap it was suggested that future courses be conducted using the facilities of the While recognising the value of the courses which have been conducted by the Commonwealth Police these must of necessity be in the nature of generalised training.
It is felt that there is also a need for specialist training by each law enforcement authority tailored to meet the needs of its organisation and the levels of knowledge and efficiency within the Two such courses have in fact been held, one by Customs and one by Tasmanian police.
Two members of Victorian Drug Squad attended the Customs course and Customs provided a lecturer for the course The matter is raised for discussion so that the respective roles of the two types of courses can be spelled out and to consider the extent to which places on the specialised training courses should be offered to fellow law enforcement agencies in Australia and overseas.
National Archives of Australia As agreed at the last meeting of the Committee on 9 February 1972, the report of the Working Party on Transport Security has been referred to the National Therapeutic Goods Committee for examination in conjunction with the Code of Good Manufacturing Practices.
The report will be considered by the August meeting of the At the last meeting of the Committee on 9 February t972, it was agreed that the States should submit reports on the monitoring system and that these reports should be reviewed by a Working Party comprising representatives from the Commonwealth Department of in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.

Manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drugs of addiction in New South Wales have now been submitting weekly returns Some of the original aims of the system have yet to be achieved, and to this extent we have been rather disappointed in its value so far.
However, there have been some ancillary benefits beyond the origins list of objectives that have compensated to some extent for the absence of some expected As originally conceived, the monitoring system was intended to assist administrative and enforcement authorities in of drugs of addiction within Australia, and to assist in supervising the licit use of drugs of addiction.
To do this efficiently, the system must be able to process information and deliver it in a form that is of use to administrative and enforcement authorities.
To date, the bulk of the information forwarded to this Department has been either of little practical value or has been in a form that must In respect of the data that has been provided to date, the regular print-outs of transactions classified by Rreporting that has really been useful at any stage has been the table hooded returns from reporting Authorities easier to refer to more up-to-date, and less bulky.
It is requested that you discontinue forwarding to this Department routine print-outs These printouts have been provided on request for thcse information that is almost impossible to obtain by other means.
Although they have suffered from the disadvantage value in both routine inspection work and in special investigations.
They have been used in the course of routine inspections to verify that drug registers are being faithfully maintained, as inspecting pharmacists can quickly compare a print-out with the receipts of drugs recorded in the register.
They have been useful in both routine inspections and in special investigations to help trace the movement of drugs and the pattern of drug usage in particular areas.
Such investigations have involved such matters as tracing the movements of addicts and detecting doctors who are prescribing large quantities of drugs of addiction without the authority of the Director-General of It is understood that the computer program has been further in decoded form.
This will greatly assist inspection pharmacists by enabling them to use their time more effectively as they will no longer have to spend time manually decoding the information.
Another development of the computer program will, l understand, enable you to provide on s regular basis decoded reports of all non reporting authorities purchasing more than a specified quantity of any drug of addiction during a four week period.
There reports will, I am told, contain details of all purchases of such drugs, and thus enable administrative and enforcement personnel to concentrate on those non-reporting authorities purchasing abnormally large quantities of drugs of addiction.
I believe that the introduction of an effective exception reporting system may provide the most significant benefit from the monitoring system.
It should provide a means of recognising more quickly movements of addicts and unusual or undesirable help to pinpcint any avenues of drug diversion that may at present be escaping detection.
One task that appears to have hen continued unnecessarily has been the physical check of stock levels at the beginning of each year.
It is understood that the computer program has omen designed to provide information on stuck held by stock check at some time during the year, it should be sufficient for international reporting and estimate purposes to use computed stock levels at the end of each year.
There may be a few reporting authorities whose reports have been found to be not sufficiently reliable for this purpose, but there shuld be few of these, and those that are unreliable might well be prevented from handling rugs of addiction in National Archives of Australia Among the unexpected benefits of the monitoring system has been the revelaticn that present methods of recording the manufacture of drug preparations are often unsatisfactory.
A method of recording manufacturing transactions which overcomes the disappearance of the drugs from the drug records during the period of manufacture has been devised by officers of this Department, and is being discussed with a number of manufacturers of drug preparations in New South Wales.
When comments have been received and the procedure tested by some of the manufacturers, I would welcome consideration of it by the Working Party, with a view to its possible adoption throughout Australia.
In summary, I would advise that the print-out of transactions by Reporting Authority is of little or no value, and it is requested that distribution of this print-out to New authorities are of value, and this value will be considerably enhanced when print-outs are provided in decoded form.
The development of exception reporting is awaited with interest, as it is believed that this may be the most useful aspect of the system from our point of view.
However, I am disappointed that the system has not so far been developed to provide decoded reports on non-reporting authorities and National Archives of Australia at of numerous narcotic outlets.
To sum un, I belleve this syeten las served nd ill serve a very useful purpese in the control of iris of addiction an the furighiny of necessary I was of the opinion that the scheme would need at least twelve months to ''Bed-domn' and it would seem e complete waste of time, money and effort if the scheme ere to he abandoned just as it is, I relive, about to produce information which will greatly assist our drug control programmes.
I believe that the computer personnel of the Commonealth Health Department should be highly commended for the manner in ihich they have devised programmes for the receipt and compilatin of the material being supplied to them.
as COPy if I refer to the Drugs of Dependence Monitoring System and advise that, to the end of 1971, this Department has used the system for the following purposes: upon receipt and all purchases in excess of predetermined levels have been investigated.
Such investigations resulted in the conviction of cone pharmaceutical chemist for the It is anticipated the promulgation of the exception reporting print out will obviate the summarising now effected in this office.
Table 4 has been invaluable in presenting information not otherwise readily available.
although no prosecution, in this context, has been based upon information presented by the computer, such information has been used in resolving situations wherein clear cut offences were not apparent.

Management of some of our reporting authorities have advised us that the existing System in this Coutry compares more than favourably with any tt operations in the Uited States of America and Europe.
This Section greatly appreciates the courtesy, advice and the considerable volume of special information it has been supplied with from the staff of the Drugs of Dependence Section, Canberra over the tx years of operation of the Monitoring System.
The monitoring system is based upon weekly reports of all movements of drugs of dependence t and from wholesalers and manufacturers.
Reports are monitored also of all supplies made and hospitals supplied by manufacturers or wholesalers.
All manufacturers and whglecelers sere specially licensed to deal in drys of addiction, all pharmacists are licensed to deal in to handle drugs of addiction, and medical department records list all Government Hospitals.
This system is based on weekly reports of movements to and from manufacturers end wholesalers in conjunction with automatic back-reporting by computer which analyses movements and provides the only valid record, incapable of falsification, of licit distribution of drugs of dependence.
This system has proved invaluable, and constitutes a major con dumb describes the problems encountered in its adoption, the situation in W.A. prior to this new system, the present situation, and touches on its logical extension.
It should be borne in mind that the system is economical in staff costs.
Few problems have arisen since the scheme commenced.
Wholesalers in general have found few problems once the mechanics have been grasped.
The few problems arising were human errors, solely results of misunderstanding the work involved.
Failure to report drugs of addiction by wholesalers is the most common fault.
Inward movements are the greater source of error: items returned for credit from pharmacies are the chief source of this error, (wholesalers enter credit returns in finance accounting elders but occasionally fail toss report these movements in weekly reports).
We have found these problems overcome as each report- ming authority gradually realises the benefits from the scheme in its own overall business administration.

An occasional fault still occurring is non reporting by the computer, or delayed appearing in a later cut out.
lye have noted progress in rectification of this.
(This caused balances of some drugs to be incorrect, and takes time to rectify).
The initial nuisance National Archives of Australia system is fairly satisfactory, reasonably simple and successful to use, and has the unique property of supplying accuracy Prior to adoption of the system, inspections were of an un satisfactory nature.
Records examined were compiled by self- interested people.
Inspections were of no real value other with accuracy; reliance was mainly on spot checks.
When errors were detected, which was frequent enough, there was little open to do but accept any plausible story.
Reliance of pre monitoring inspection procedure was largely on untrained or partially trained personnel who, with the best of goodwill, accumulated experience with efflurion of time and reached a position of limited understanding.
Suspicions and knowledge of leaks to other States gave rise to an atmosphere of concern.
The prior position was unsatisfactory and caused misgivings in the light of a drug problem which, it was felt, was due to be imported into Australia, Two unqualified inspectors are able to carry out inspecticns with accuracy since the adoption of the monitoring system.
These inspectors are also used to investigate other problems in connection with poisons and pesticides as these occur and when these are within their capabilities).
Such economic use of unqualified personnel as this can give rise to perfect in sections as the checking of suppliers' stocks and records is on the basis of our own records or movements.
Inspections are now cumplete under each category at intervals appropriate to the nature of the dealer's poisons, (numbers and Wholesalers have tightened up procedures and are glad to have done so.
Wholesalers' failures in appointing suitable staff have come to the attention of wholesalers automatically without involving personal elements.
Since adoption of the monitoring system there have not been any reports of leakage of drugs of dependence via any inform- National Archives of Australia It appears that work involved in the system still reduces with evoluticnary use whilst giving the same result - abolition of leakages from licit sources with a certainty of detection.
It is further felt that should criminal organisatins produce tin of reporting and reporting back procedures would defeat The scheme has been the key to preventin of dispersion of licit materials to illicit areas.
The full economic advantage of the scheme is not capable of estimation, particularly in the light of costs of detecting, convicting and imprisoning illicit dealers and the high cost of treating addicts.
It is submitted that further effort should be made to maintain provement in information provided to State authorities.
As far as Tasmania is concerned the scheme of previously existed in regard to interstate transactions by enabling diversions from the licit trade to be more In edition, it has now become complementary to the scheme operating in Tasmania whereby all Pharmacists, including Hospital Pharmacists, submit to the Department a monthly return of all acquisitions and disposals of dangerous drugs which includes the name of the patient and the prescribing doctor alon with the name of the drug for each dispensed It is now possible for a cross checking of the computer printout and a Pharmacist's records to be made in the office so lat any discrepancy can be detected before a Pharmacy is Since its inception the monitoring system has enabled a number of breaches of Regulations to be detected which sttis;ticel infirmation on drug usage which is currently patterns for dangerous drugs in Tasmania.
The introduction of exception reporting will be of assistance in highlighting transactions which probably need most urgent attention.
In summary, it is considered that the system, from this state's point of view, is a very useful operation and the co-operuation and assistance afforded by the officers National Archives of Australia RESEARCH BACKGROUND (a) that the Commonwealth make available prohibited drugs for approved research programmes; special allocation of funds to the National Standing Control Committee in order that research into all aspects ofthe problem of drug abuse be fostered; (c) that funds so allocated should be earmarked for this purpose and that projects put forward should be evaluated through the mechanism of the Medical Research Advisory Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council.
Grants for 1977 and 1972 have been made by the National Health and Medical Research Council for the following new research projects: monitoring trends in drug use and abuse.

National Archives of Austral Attached is a copy of correspondence received from the Directors General of Health Services, Tasuenia, concerning a request for additional funds during the current financial year as discussed at the last meeting of the rational Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence.
I understand that this matter is already listed for discussion National Archives of Australia DIRECTOR GNERAL OF HEALTH SERVICES TASMANIA Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery At last week's meeting of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence in Devonport, submissions were invited for the use of unallocated funds during the current financial year.
I submit for your consideration my request for 83,O00 to develop a proposed Drug Education Exhibit Public Health with schematic diagrams which I am enclosing together with a letter setting out the rationale behind Mr. Ellis is calling at this Department on Thursday 7th February, to inform of his progress, and I shall successful exhibit on the dangers of smoking and he followed it up with a questionnaire analysis of its possible long This proposed exhibit would be especially meritorious in that it can travel to other States and truly become not only part of the National Drug Education Programnme, but the property of the Commonwealth Government.
Director-General of Health Services National Archives of Australia QUEEN VICTORIA MUSEUM AND ART GALLERY Director of Public Health, This letter follows the lines discussed with Mr. Farmer last week and is intended to inform you of the direction and development of the drug education display.
Following adoption of the general plan for the project, we required information on the motivation factors which we are to counter and the intellectual characteristics of the group(s) concerned.
The publications you supplied have provided some of the former and, as you see by the notes attached, I have concluded subjects and observers, indicating their validity.
(2) that these factors can be graded by the level of intellectual activity and active social involvement displayed, possibly matching the intelligence of the subsects concerned.
As you may recall, we suspect a division in the response to your previous exhibit ''smoking and cancer'' according to the intelligence of the children who viewed its the average to lower level groups conforming to the information and advice supplied authoritively while some highly intelligent individuals showed a tendency to question, even to take a counterposition, thus reversing the effect desired.
Obviously, we must not present any inducement to experiment with drugs.
We can design a display, appealing and comprehensible to intelligent people, which would not convey any significant message to those of low intelligence.
Can you tell me if Australian drug subjects are schemed u or don the average Lee scale?
I suspect the majority may be more active intellectually than average, in which case we can weight our display accordingly, as suggested above.
he At present, I envisage the theme of the display as shown on the diagram attached.
The main theme will be the moral structure and function of the nervous system.
Temporary impairment of this normal function by analgesics and anaesthetics can be compared to permanent impairment by disease and organ damage.
Fluctuating between these effects, according to the substances taken, quantities and duration, lie the effects of drugs.
This, I believe, will allow us to warn of the severe irreversible effects but hold out some hope of recovery in other cases.
It also allows discussion on some effects of drugs through those of other causes, obviating undue obvious emphasis on the drug The main elements of the presentation would be:; The nervous system - structure and function.
The effects of mechanical damage - trephining by primitive The effects of disease - pharmaceutical purposes, with their general effects, combined National Archives of Australia DRUG EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS BASIC PURPOSE OF WORKSHOP To bring appropriate officers of Education Departments together to work out times of development for programs and materials for use in schools to counteract pressures on young people to embark on drug taking.
SE College to be used if available.
OUTLINE OF PROGRAM The Workshop should review the patterns of drug abuse among young people in Australia and in relevant conditions overseas, and endeavour to identify the circumstances that lead to drug abuse in this age group, and ways in which school programs may combat these.
The bulk of the Workshop's time should be spent in pursuing the general objective outlined above.
This might best be done by break- ming the membership into smaller groups to discuss and report on aspects of the problem.
The success of the Workshop will depend on, among other things, adequate preparatory work, which should include situation statements covering the current situation (provision for drug education, problems, etch) in each State as well as background information likely to be useful to workshop members.
Preparatory work, including arrangements for the Workshop itself, would be likely to take several months.

The social and emotional issues which cloud clear thinking in this debate are further complicated by a general lack of knowledge of the true effects and hazards of marihuana use.
It is true that there is a wealth of data on the effects of marihuana.
Unfortunately, these data emanate from widely scattered studies which have little in common as regards approach, method and definition.
Valid comparison between such studies is difficult but it is known that marihuana is an intoxicant, a property it shares with other drugs that affect the mind.
Scientifically reliable studies have shown the potential of the drug to distort perception of time and space, to modify mood, to impair judgment and coy ordination and to initiate unpredictable behaviour.
Evidence of brain and liver damage from long term use in the individual is available and there is also the possibility of damage to the unborn child.
These effects, both mental and physical, point to larihene end other drug The plant Cannabis Sativa (Indian Hemp) and the drugs derived from it are known by many different names.
National Archives of Australia This should not be confused with the concentrated resin tt from the flowering tops of the female plant which is known as hashish or charas.
The resin contains a high concentration of and is many times the potency of marihuana.
No drug, no matter how thoroughly tested, is entirely safe.
Even valuable drugs used in medical treatment involve some hazards and can cause undesirable side effects.
However, marihuana is in a special class in that it has no use in medical treatment and until recently scientific evaluation has not been attempted.
Governments are often charged with being inconsistent in allowing the use of alcohol and tobacco while prohibiting There is no doubt that both alcohol and tobacco when have been better without them.
They have, however, been with us for centuries and are firmly imprinted in the fabric of modern society.
In these circumstances it would be foolish to believe that any attempt at prohibiting either of them could now be successful.
But the fact that our society suffers from and yet tolerates tobacco and alcohol is no reason why we should accept marihuana.
It is not logical to demand the addition of a third possible hazard to mankind simply because two others of a similar kind already exist.
National Archives of Australia The question does not only concern marihuana nor marihuana versus alcohol but rather how many intoxicants we can add to our already excessive consumption and still have a healthy The Australian Government, along with the governments of most countries, believes that in the present state of knowledge it would be irresponsible to alter legislation to allow the use of yet another intoxicating drug.
Thought provoking evidence As has already been pointed out, available scientific evidence suggests that the use of marihuana is extremely unwise.
it is worth listing effects that have been noted in recent Brain damage A significant report was published in the December 4, roar findings indicate that there is a particular pattern of cerebral atrophy in a series of young men who smoked cannabis.

One of the most important tests was carried out by a group at the Stanford University School of Medicine, California among University graduate students.
The group included Dr. Leo Hollister of the Department of Medicine and Psychiatry.
The test showed that subjects under the influence of marihuana suffered confusion concerning their sense of time and this as attributed to interference with their shorty term and immediate further tests by the Stanford Group suggest that this future for the individual, causes him to experience himself as National Archives of Australia Such an experience can cause the individual to fear that loss of identity and control of self may not end, and actus anxiety and a panic reaction may arise.

A copy is attached for your further perusal.
Looking ahead to the forthcoming year, it is clear that while the basic organisation for technical services, training, field services for areas with a high risk of drug abuse and evaluation remains adequate, the pre- sure on the project has become greater than it can currently support in two respects: (a) the education of key professional groups such as teachers, I therefore find it necessary to seek to increase the temporary full time staff by two Health Education Officers to meet these needs as This officer will be responsible for organising and administering educational facilities for special key groups.
He will for example assist the educationist with our series of teacher workshops, since the Education Department has requested that attempts be made to provide at least one trained teacher in each high school by the end of the 1972-73 year.
This will require at least 30 workshops to be arranged.
He will also assist in augmenting the education programme for large professional groups such as nurses, with whom work has already started but the demand is too great to be met by the educationist without assistance.
It is apparent that the one country officer now available cannot meet the many requests to initiate programmes in country areas.

The main air is to prevent the noncommitted from adopting habits which could lead to drug dependency.
It is based on the general adoption of more discriminating attitudes towards using mind-altering 3. The programme attempts to present drug use and abuse as one of a number of related social issues.
Drug abuse is not seen as an isolated phenomenon but as a reaction to many environmental pressures.
Such reactions by young people particularly involve responses to authority and parents and may find expression in permissiveness and public protest.
4. In one sense, drug abuse is seen as a symptom of poor current mental health in some sections of the community.
The programme is based on group discussion of all these issues.
Individual behaviour and attitudes are influenced by peer pressures, commonly identification with a group and respect for the values of admired persons.
Discussion is used largely as the medium through which such external forces act and the programme aims to open up the whole issue of drugs and their potential for abuse in frank discussion based on factual information supplied continuously by the project staff.

Superintendent Port Adelaide Central Mission National Archives of Austala The drug scene in South Australia is an area of public health where accurate information is all too sparse.
Some valuable work has been done in analysing the use of a variety of drugs but even this has been hampered by difficulties involved in gaining access to appropriate records.
In the main, public opinion has been formed by press reports, fins and television programmes that tend to sensationalise rather than educate.
Discussions with General Practitioners usually result in assertions that the 'drug problem'''in Adelaide is of a minor nature.
The consequences of excessive consumption of alcohol and the addictive quality of nicotine are said to be of far greater significance to personal health and social functioning.
Reference is also made to the multitude of prescriptions for university students, hippy communities and the art world.
More recent information draws attention to the drug taking habits of middle aged, stay-at-home housewives and the trend towards experimenting with drugs among secondary school students.
There is also concern about the consumption of certain drugs by elderly members of the community.
It is believed that Australia will follow the patterns discerned in the United Kingdom and North America because of our similarity in life styles.
Our comparative affluence and high degree of urbanisation are other factors which point to Australia experiencing a 'drug problem' similar to that in the overseas areas mentioned.
While there is a continuing flow of research material from overseas, little basic research has been commissioned in Australia.
One of the reasons for lack of research here is the cost involved in carrying out reliable work.
Much time has to be spent in defining the field of research in precise terms, designing research procedures, gathering the material and processing the data.
After much time and effort, the findings not infrequently confirm conclusions that have already been drawn by intuition or informed opinion.
However, it can be argued that it would be reassuring to know that one's hunches were supported by reliable research data, especially when the expenditure of public monies on community education programmes were involved.
Bearing in mind then, the shortage of objective data and the confusion which seems to surround the drug scene in South Australia, the following proposal is submitted for consideration.
A statistical analysis of the use of drugs in South Australia, especially in the metropolitan area of Adelaide.
2. A survey of community attitudes towards drug use and abuse.
3. A survey of the incidence of drug abuse in South Australia together with the personal and social consequences of same.
An evaluation of the existing public health drug education positing a comprehensive community drug education programme.
It is proposed that the research project be spread over two years.
In year one, emphasis would be placed upon definition National Archives of Australia of the research, statistical analysis and questionnaire design.
Some preliminary findings could be available after six months but the bulk of the findings from actual fieldwork would not be available until the second year.
Close co-operation with the Department cf Public Health would be necessitated by the need to define 'drugs'' and to establish 2. The project would be supervised by the staff of Port Adelaide Central Mission.
A qualified staff member would be sociology, questionnaire design and education would be retained on a sessional basis.
It would also be essential to purchase computer time to facilitate the processing of material.
A cooperative relationship would be established with the Australian Medical Association, Mental Health Services and the Police Drug Squad.
3. Literature from culturally similar countries would be reviewed together with an appreciation of research carried out in Australia.
4. Most of the field work would be based on Adelaide but it is felt that a limited study could also be warranted in a town like Port Lincoln where it is thought that 'drug running'' presents less hazards than Port Adelaide.
Interviews in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Newcastle could also provide some basis for comparative comment. 5. All available and relevant statistical data would be examined and collated.
This would include not only statistics for the sale of particular drugs but also for the personal and social consequences of drug abuse.
An attempt would be made to bring together groups of people representative of the wider groups in the community thought secondary school students would be brought together for National Archives of Australia discussions structured to produce information useful to the design and administration of questionnaires to a larger 7. Reference would be made to experts in the design of major questionnaires.
It is believed that this is crucial to the reliable measurement of the incidence of drug abuse, prevalence in a given area and community attitudes.
The selection of sample populations would be made in close consultation with the Department of Public Health.
Then would follow the administration of the questionnaires and processing the results with the aid of a computer.
9. Findings would be tabulated and serve as the basis for achieving 3. Members of the medical and paramedical professions.

Computer survey analysis Secretarial assistance Note: A financial statement would be forwarded to the Department as required.
In the event of any monies remaining unexpended, a refund would be made to the Department.
It is pointed out that no figure has been given for the provision of office space and equipment or for supervision by Mission staff and application of their expertise.
This would be a contribution on the part of the Missiofthe project.
National Archives of Australia Port Adelaide Central Mission has a record of more than 50 years in social welfare work.
It is an agency of the Methodist Church and is responsible to the Annual Conference of that body.
Because the agency receives grants from the State and Commonwealth Governments for specialised purposes it is also responsible to the appropriate Departments for performing certain services.
At the present time the Mission staff includes four University trained social workers and a part-time qualified teacher.
A fifth social worker will take up her appointment on lOth April.
Staff members have carried out research recently into 'Community Attitudes projects were also used towards University Honours work and brought a Distinction and Credit respectively.
Due to contacts with overseas and interstate agencies which have expertise in areas directly related to this research proposal, it is believed that the Mission is capable of mounting the project and carrying it through.
Close relationships have been forged with the social work section of the Institute of Technology and the Department of Sociology and Social Administration at Flinders University.
Staff members have been generous in making available their experience to the Mission for various facets of its work.
Their experience would be invaluable to the proposed research project outlined above.

The support of Comnmonwealth funds has made it possible to extend a Modern Social Issues programme which was already in existence.
Due emphasis has been placed on drug dependence as a major and These programmes have involved both adults and high school students in examining together a range of iter-related health Fifteen programmes have been conducted in Perth and eighteen in country areas.
This does not include the programmes conducted in Nursing Schools.

A two week University Summer School entitled ''Social Issues and Medicine'' was mounted in conjunction with the College of General Practitioners and the University Adult Education Service.
This created widespread public interest and gained maximum press A long-term project in a large centrally positioned youth centre was begun, but work was deferred due to financial limitations.
A number of well-qualified part-time workers were given special training to conduct a four-part series of drug education discussions consisting of: 3. Facts of Drug Dependence This programme was designed to cope with panic reactions to the drug question which reached mildly hysterical proportions at the The impact of this programme appeared to be successful because clear that talks treating drugs in isolation were not the answer to basic community needs.
Just as other special information campaigns about V.D., Heart Disease or Smoking have a limited purpose, and cannot be sustained over long periods, There were sixtyone of these programmes entirely in the This series is still available, but requests are now for long-term social issues programmes.

This provides a widespread network of informed people able to act in local A cadre of selected lay group leaders were trained to act as discussion facilitators in the Modern Social Issues and Drug Education programmes in the metropolitan area.
A second team of fourteen student-nurses completed six months' discussion training and rendered invaluable service in the Modern Social Issues programmes.
They were particularly effective with student groups.
A close working co-operation has been maintained with the Mental Health Services, often seen to be in the front-line of treatment of drug dependent and socially disoriented people.
Support has been given to a Human Relationships Workshop Programme and other social projects carried out by Mental Health Services.
Also exploratory meetings have been held with representatives of Police Drug Squad, Mental Health Services, Inebriates Board, and other agencies concerned with the issue of drug dependence.
A project of Community Human Relationships Workshops was commenced despite the low priority given by the N.S.C.C.D.D. A total of thirtyone workshops were conducted in the period, and thirteen more are committed.
This project was in association with Mental Health Services.
This Service has now assumed responsibility for the This project is regarded as highly successful.
It has produced a network of thirtyone informed groups, each of which has worked together for at least twentytwo weeks on this issue.
A quarterly conference of participants now operates, and plans are in hand for follow-up workshops, all of which have direct relevance to the drug issue.
Seven of these have commenced.
More of this work should be undertaken.
This developmental experience seems to have made a significant contribution to community understanding of health issues, to the extent that no major drug problem has yet emerged in Western As a result of this experience, Community Development is seen as the educational effort most likely to produce results in drug Difficulties experienced due to economic factors have caused some rctrenchment of staff and a consequent curtailment of field projects.
It is hoped, however, that these may be resumed when funds again permit.
National Archives of Australia It is still the local view that the framework of the drug education programme is appropriate and likely to be effective in minimising the growth of the drug problem.

Attached for the information of members is a report by Dr. Edmondson on a visit to the Drug Epidemiology Unit of the is relevant to this item.
National Archives of Australia The first meeting of the Working Party on statistics following were present: 1.
The Chairman welcomed members to the Meeting.
An apology was received from Dr. A. Bartholomew who was unable to attend as he was going overseas.
The Chairman advised that he had received a paper from Dr. Bartholomew dealing paper was circulated to members at the Meeting.
1.2 The Chairman described events leading up to the formation of the Working Party by the N.H.
M.R.C. Mental Health Committee and outlined the reasons for its establishment.
2.t The Working Party had been directed to investigate the possible linking of medical and forensic approaches to the collection of statistics of addiction.
2.2 In doing so, it would be necessary to take into account both social and ethical aspects and ensure that any system devised did not interfere with action either in the health or the penal areas.
2.3 Other important aspects to be examined were reasonable and uniform definitions as well as regular and confidential 3.1 It would be necessary to consider how private sectors could be involved in the collection of statistics of addiction.
3.3 Differences in methods of collection were apparent between States and also between the various agencies in individual National Archilves of Australia 3.4 The question of overlap by the various agencies should be 4.
The Chairman pointed out that there was a need for the collection of accurate information at a State level as 4.2 The Commonwealth required accurate uniform statistics so that its obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotics and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances could be met.
4.3 The States needed accurate information to plan essential services and programmes.
4.4 Both the Commonwealth and the States require accurate statistics in order to assess the sice of the drug dependence problem in Australia.
5.1 The Chairman pointed out that he considered the following should be considered: (ii) the collection of data from as wide an area of involvement as possible; (ivy the central collection of statistics without intimidating people; and Committee on Drugs of Dependence and to the 5.2 The Chairman advised members that it would be possible to have people co-opted to the Working Party to provide special information or data.
5.3 The Chairman then described current surveys into drug behaviour being carried out by the Victorian Mental Health 5.4 Members present covered the standard Stats addiction collection, the social welfare and police areas, so it should be possible to look meaningfully into the problems better ascertained following a more comprehensive under- standing of the problems which beset the people who were actually working in the collection areas.
6.2 Detective Sergeant Currie reported on the Victorian Police 6.2.1 There was no specific definition as far as an addict was concerned.
The Police realised that there were both psychological and physical forms of addiction and they were guided by what they saw or were told by the person.
If the person said he was constantly taking morphine then they would have no hesitation in recording him as an addict.
The addiction problem would need to be obvious before the person was recorded as an addict.
6.2.2 Up until the present, marihuana smokers had not been recorded as drug dependent.
It was only on the rare occasion that the Police handled a person with withdrawal symptoms at the or after the person was bailed out.
at Pentridge was contacted and an examination was offender was bailed out or assisted by the Buoyancy Foundation.
Often when the offender is bailed out, he later presents himself at court with a private 6.2.5 A person became a statistical unit once he committed an offence involving drugs.
The ordinary local police forms were filled in (the criminal offence and then transferred to a Drug Intelligence Report Form and this was forwarded to the Commonwealth Police in Canberra.
These forms were filled in irrespective of whether a person was charged or convicted.
62.6 Offences in order of incidence were possession 6.2.7 Quite a large percentage of offenders involved were not drug abusers and because of this, police statistics would overstate addiction.
National Archives of Austala 6.2.8
If one person committed more than one offence, then separate reports were made for each offence.
6.2.9 Victorian Police records were kept by detectives; the records were designed to assist them operationally not to provide a system of statistical collection.
6.3 Superintendent Williams explained that a standardised form was used by the Commonwealth Police and circulated copies to members.
He reported concerning Commonwealth Police 6.3.1 Commonwealth Police did not define an addict as such.
They did not consider themselves competent to give a medical definition of addiction.
They could only look at the offender.
They had the problem of different methods of collection by the Police in the various States eg.
recidivist had been deleted from the present form as police in different States gave the term different 6.3.4
Records would soon be available for two complete years.
6.3.5 Offenders were not counted twice so there was no duplication at their level.
Reports from each State were checked on a name basis and if queries were raised, were sent back to States for further these were a valuable means of identification.
Commonwealth Police were working towards uniform statistics on crime not on drug addiction.
6.4 Dr. Rutter pointed out that the main function of his area at a State Health level was to control the legal use of 6.4.1 Hallucinogens were controlled by the Victorian Health Department.
A number of psychiatrists had warrants to use L.S.D. and psilocybin but their use had reduced to almost nil.
Amphetamines have been controlled since April 1970 and there are now about ninety patients dependent 6.4.3
Only six addicts on narcotics have been notified by doctors.
A lot of others have been treated with narcotise for periods exceeding eight weeks but it was difficult to differentiate between those dependent and those not.
National Archives of Australia for up to ten years without increasing the dose.
As it was realised that a lot of Victorian doctors were not aware that it was necessary to obtain permission for the long term use of narcotics, a notice had been placed in the A.M.A. Newsletter. to advise them of State requirements.
In some cases, long term usage had been reported by pharmacists to inspectors and in this way, narcotics and Schedule I a permit for the patient for a period depending on the circumstances.
When the term has expired, the doctor is asked if he wishes to continue.
Records are not always accurate as a doctor often stops prescribing during the allowed period.

The media indicates thatthe drug problem is rather large but the Unit does not see this.

7. VICTORIAN STUDY OF DRUG USAGE AND 7.
This study was of persons under 30 years of age.
These cases were collected from Fairfield Hospital, the Youth Division, Penal Divisions and Buoyancy Foundation.
7.3 An addict had been defined according to the amount and frequency of administration.
These were related to the type of drug.
7.5 Some of the cases were involved in the illicit buying and selling of drugs; some were in contact with the police, some were not.
7.6 The people interviewed were not necessarily representative of all drug users.
Interviewers were paid $8 per person 7.7 Once the obvious hard drug users were interviewed, it had been difficult to find further users.

This percentage was steady for all schools in the pilot.
7.10 Questions were included concerning tobacco, alcohol and medication and the use of drug scene jargon.
7.11 Impressions gained already indicated that people are starting at an earlier age to experiment with drugs.

In the drug users' study, three questions concerning their attitude towards their own addiction had 8.4 Members discussed the possibility of the establishment of.
8.5 Detective Sergeant Currie pointed out that many persons became addicted to their living environment before they became addicted to drugs.
Drug addiction developed gradually and abusers were reluctant to give up drugs because of the group or area in which they were living.
Most abusers had a history of disturbed family life, were 8.6 The question of anonymity in relation to a central register was discussed.
It was agreed that a person should not be able to make use of his registration and it again should not be open to use against him.
Records in a central register would require a high degree of security.
8.7 The Courts were inclined to be lenient on those dependent 8.8 There was a further problem in Victoria as there was no place where addicts could be confined for treatment.
8.9 Many of the users are trafficking but because of their dependence receive sympathetic treatment in the courts.
8.1O The problems of getting people on the register were discussed and reference was made to the U system where registration had been encouraged because a supply of drugs was then available.
National Archives of Australia A OF STATISTICS 9.1 The Chairman printed out that a certain amount of data was available from different agencies.'
If a pilot study was undertaken in Victoria, it would then be possible to gee how the general police approach related to the health approach and ascertain the overlap.
Information could be Health, Mental Health and Infectious Diseases areas.
9.2 Health and Police collections of statistics could be seen on parallel lines and then the two could be co-ordinated where they came into interaction.
It would then be possible to assess whether a combined' system was feasible.
9.3 Dr. Chatg enquired if the Working Party was in favour of a central drug register.
each agency should be recorded in the central register whether they had health problems or not.
9.5 The Chairman suggested that a pilot project should be carried out in New South ales as well as in Victoria.
key people in the collection areas should get together and investigate the possibility of co-operation in recording data over a period of one year.
9.6 Members agreed that the U.N. questionnaire was to complicated to be filled in under the present circumstances.
9.8 Members agreed that it would be best for the present tc It would be an impossible teaks at this stage to obtain figures on dependence on barbiturates and allied drugs.
9.9 Cross matching of names was discussed and it was agreed for this purpose.
However, there was a problem here from an ethical point of view.
Everyone contributing to the Register could be inclined to expect access to the records.
9.10 Superintendent Williams advised that he believed that there would be no objection by the Police if the National Standing Control Committee on rugs of Dependence recommended that Police should not have access.
National Archives of Australia 9. It was suggested that to obtain anonymity, it may be necessary to involve the Bureau of Census and Statistics 9.12 Members agreed that the W.H.O.
definition of dependence was not suitable for use.
It would be better to use the questions from the Victorian Study Questionnaire so that an operational definition could be determined.
9.13 Members discussed the possibility of alerting the medical profession to its responsibility in reporting drug 9.14 It was agreed that it would be necessary to build in mechanisms in the collection to overcome possible overlap.

9.7 Members agreed that the following medical sources should be involved in the pilot operations in each State: a) Poisons Division of State Health Department: 9.18 Approval for the pilot test would have to be obtained from the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence and also funds to provide the extra services required.
Permission would need to be obtained from the 9.19 Victoria could offer the Mental Health Research Institute facilities to handle the pilot test in Victoria.

9.2t General hospitals would be included in the list of may be possible to co-opt somebody for the next meeting from the Medical Records Section of the general hospitals area, also somebody from the Bureau of Census and Statistics.
The Working Party on Statistics of Addiction recommended that: (i) a report should be prepared on the deliberations of the Working Party and submitted to the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence before referral (ii) the National Standing Control Committee should be advised (a) at this stage it would not be practicable to include barbiturates and allied drugs in any statistical collection of drug dependent persons; of collection on a nation -wide basis, a pilot study should be conducted for one year in Victoria and also in New South Wales, if this was possible; (c) finance will be required to implement the pilot study to cover the services (clerical) of one person full- time, the printing of relevant forms and the processing of data; statistics along parallel lines and the following medical services should be involved in the pilot operations in each State: poisons Division of State Health Department Youth Welfare Services Infectious Diseases Agencies Voluntary Service Agencies oversee the pilot studies in the two States.
We have no real idea just what the problem size is as far as the prison is concerned.
This is because: (a) many persons who are drug dependent are charged with offences which cover up the drug problem eg.
Breaking and entering; (b) the social welfare department has no efficient or effective statistical scheme such as that under the direction of 2. We are aware that the drug problem in Pentridge is increasing, and increasing at a fairly rapid rate simply in terms of clinical 3. The drug takers we see in Pentridge come in two main forms: experimental endeavours.
These persons require little or with frightens them out of their behaviour; these persons are seriously psychiatrically ill.
Often they are not recognised until well into their sentence; psychoses that there is little hope of doing more than controlling their withdrawal symptoms and giving very superficial counselling.
This is a cause of considerable annoyance to the drug dependent offender who tends to feel (a) we know more certainly who are the drug dependent persons.
This means better communication with the police - all such persons, however charged, should be communicated to the prison medical authorities; (b) an effective statistical system so that old findings are permanently recorded - this means that aliases must be workers if we can do more than document such persons; National Archives of Australia some access to a number for their own patients.
No one is very interested in simply weeding out interesting cases for other persons to treat; or else the staff will not wish to find the drug cases - it makes the work load too great and the prisoners dislike it.

National Archives of Australia Agenda Item U.N. CONFERENCE TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS TO The abovementioned conference was held in Geneva from Ninety four countries were represented at the conference.
The Australian delegation comprised: Australia was represented on the Credentials Committee and Committees I and II.
Most countries were represented on Committees I and II which the conference had agreed would each consider a share of the proposed Amendments.
Because of this the major discussion took place in Committee rather than in Plenary.
The protocol enters into force following ratification or accession by States which have ratified or acceded to the Single THE MAIN PROVISIONS: Attached is a statement which sets out: (a) the existing related provisions of the Single Convention; The more significant Amendments contained in the Protocol relate to estimates and the powers and functions of the International provisions are contained in the following paragraphs.
Article 9 of the Protocol amends Article 19 of the Single Convention to require Parties to provide estimates for: (a) the area to be used in the cultivation of opium poppy; (d) the quantity of synthetic drugs to be manufactured by each In supporting the provisions relating to opium the Australian delegation explained our position concerning the planting of opium in one calendar year and the harvesting in the following year.
We emphasised that, while we were prepared to look at alternative proposals, our estimates for the area of opium poppy cultivation for a particular year would be the actual area planted in the previous year.
No alternative proposals were received.
If Australia adopts the Protocol it will be required to furnish estimates for the area of opium poppy to be cultivated despite the fact that the crop will not be used for opium The amendments in relation to synthetic drugs were supported by opium producing countries.
These Amendments were an effort to remove the discrimination which opium producing countries felt resulted from all the Amendments relating to opium.
Australia did not support the amendments in relation to and 21 bibs respectively of the Single Convention) relate to the Conference agreed that, in the case of disagreement betmeen a party and the I.N.C.B. on the estimate submitted for any drug, the The I.N.C.B. representative explained that it was up to the exporting country to then decide whether to adopt the estimate of the importing country or that of the I.N.C.B.
The I.N .C.B. was also empowered to reduce a party's estimate for opium in cases where any excess of production by that party found its way into the illicit traffic.
This provision was intended to encourage all parties to introduce proper controls.
The powers of the IN.C.B. were broadened by the Amendments in such areas as the rights of the Board to require explanation; to bring certain circumstances to the notice of parties and international bodies and to visit a country.
However, there is as an overriding requirement that the I.N.C.B. must always consult and, in some areas, have the agreement of the party concerned before the Board can exercise these powers.
National Archives of Australia The principal objections to the broadening of the Bard's voiced by opium producing countries and Eastern Bloc countries.
The grounds for their opposition were as follows- (a) the proposals offended international law in that they empowered the Board to intrude upon the sovereignty.
proposals were discriminatory against opium producing countries; and (d) the reduction of estimates by the amount used for illicit purposes could result in shortages for bona fide The remaining articles of the Protocol predominantly reflect the kinds of measures the conference deemed it was desirable for parties to adopt.
Much of the strength of the Protocol is removed by the reservation provisions which apply to all of the more significant Amendments mentioned above.
Nevertheless the Protocol may prove worthmhile inasmuch as it should encourage parties to take more stringent measures to prevent drug trafficking.
