Projects and Legislation National Archives of Australia I propose to include the question of Australia's participation in the abovementioned Convention on the amende for the next meeting of the Folloming discussion by the N.S.C.C. a committee convened by the Commonmealth Department of Health has been examining the Convention to establish what legislative changes might be necessary to enable Australia to become a party to the Convention.
I visualise that, at its next meeting, the N.S.C.C. will reconcile its attitude to the Convention.
I mould hope that the Committee mill be in a position to report to ministers on the desirability of adopting the Convention.
Furthermore, if the Committee supports adoption of the Convention it will be able to state the nature of any administrative and legislative changes necessary to enable that adoption to be formalised.
Records of the proceedings of the Vienna Conference have not, as yet, come to hand.
The attached comparison and explanation paper has been prepared to assist representatives, particularly those who have not been involved in the committee convened by the Department of Health, in understanding the provisions of the Convention and to explain changes which were made in the draft Protocol.
In order to facilitate the discussion by the N.S.C.C.
I would appreciate your prior advice on matters connected with the Convention in respect of which you require clarification or on which you would request full discussion.
Yours sincerely, Acting Assistant Secretary, department of the Interior, National Archives of Australia gm f opium Poppy in Australi Attached for your information is the report of the above- mentioned meeting which was held in Melbourne on 2l June, 197l.
As indicated therein, action is being taken to bring the conclusions of the meeting to the attention of Ministers concerned.
The question of devitalization of opium poppy seed will be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of N.S.C.C. scheduled for late Agust or early September.

Several States added the proviso that this applied if cultivation was confine to There wes general agreement that tasmania should be the sole ares of cultivation, on the understanding that abbott, Australia, be alloyed to underate cultivation in Tasmania should they so desire.
The iranian representatives in explaining their State's policies (a) All poppy material had to be dispersed of by farmers to the licenser (b) The government would not licence cultivation of areas in excess of those needed for the manufacturer's quota.
ce) Easmania had introduced legislation making unauthorized possession of poppy material, other than seeds, an offence State provided they were licensed and had manufacturing quota.
The Chairman pointed out that there were misgivines regarding security in the tasmanian poppy fields and asked the Tasmanian representatives to outline the position.
(a) Close attention was given to controlling and recording data regariias all harvesting of poppy material.
National Archives ofAustaia (c) Roadside crops could create a problem of misuse by experimenters, an aspect receiving close attention.

Illicit production of opium was unlikely, because of difficulties in readily obtaining enough late.
(e) The Police visited farmers and the fields regularly to inspect areas, instil in people the need for security and report on any regrowth.
The Chairman proposed that, subject to agreement by Ministers regarding cultivation further talks take place between the Tasmanian authorities and Customs on these matters and that they report back to ii.S.C.C.
It was so agreed.
It mas agreed also that arrangements be made to provide to Police and Health authorities samples of milled and unmilled poppy straw for identification and training purposes.
The question of devitalisation of poppy see was deferred to the next meeting of li S .C.C.
The meeting decided that its conclusions should be reported direct to liinisters, rather than delay matters by referring them through the next meeting National Archives of Australia First Assistant Secretary National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence A meeting of this Committee was held in the Premier's The main item on the agenda concerned a proposal to confine all commercial Opium Poppy growing to the State of Tasmania.
The need for a decision in this matter arose because a wholesale drug firm had approached the N.S .W. Government for permission to conduct comprehensive trials to determine whether the plant could be grown commercially in that State.
The following reasons were considered to be valid in confining all commercial production to Tasmania :- security - Tasmania is an island state.
.Experteze had been achieved in improving commercial strains of the plant by a company operating in Tasmania.
This proposal was agreed to by all States.
Some reservations were expressed by representatives of the N.S.W, and West Australian Governments.
Both reserved the right to consider growing the poppy in their State if permission was given to propagate it outside of Tasmania.
As a representative of this Department, I indicated that the A.C.T. Lands Division and they N.T.
Administration were agreeable to the proposal to confine the growing of Opium Poppies in Tasmania.
Several other aspects of Opium Poppy growing were licensing of growers by the Department of Customs and Excise.
security in transfer of harvested material to the manufacturing site.
.The importation of seed in fertile condition.
These matters were of no real concern to this Department.
However, apart from the general aspects of controlling the growth of the Opium Poppy as a drug plant, it is considered desirable for such a small agricultural industry to be restricted to a given area.
In the light of present needs the total acreage required would be approximately 5,000 acres.
If production was allowed in several States, the Department of Customs and Excise could well be asked to licence more areas than were actually required to meet the requirement of the industry.

At the meeting of Ministers which was held in Sydney on 26th March, 1971 it was agreed that the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence should examine the question of the extent to which the cultivation of opium poppy should be permitted in Australia.
Ministers envisaged that, having regard to Australia's obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961, the Committee should consider such matters as:- (a) the areas in which cultivation should be permitted; (b) the conditions under which permits be granted to farmers to cultivate opium poppy: (e) the authorities to be responsible for controls; ( the security of storage and transport of poppy straw and the production therefrom; aDO.
(g) the treatment of seed for use in other than growing In order to expedite the work of the NSC it seems to me that representatives of interested departments should meet as soon as possible with a view to exchanging ideas on the subject.
I believe that these representatives should seek to draw up some positive proposals for con deration by the NSC, and ultimately by Ministers.
Attached is a paper which has been prepared with a view to informing departments of some historical and legal matters concerning the cultivation of opium poppy in Australia.
In order that a suitable venue for the meeting of representatives can be arranged I should be glad of your advice of the name of the representative (if any) you propose to nominate to attend.

The Single Convention provides for strict controls over cultivation of the opium poppy for production of opium.
Homever, as Australia does not permit the cultivation of opium poppy for production of opium the procedures are not dealt with in this paper.
Article 25 of the Single Convention requires that all necessary measures be taken to ensured- (a) opium is not produced from poppies grown for production tins is applied to poppy straw; and (d) that statistical information on the import and export of poppy straw is furnished to the International 2. Constitutional Aspect The Comonmealth has the power to enact legislation with respect to all matters provided for in the Single Convention.
The ertent, however, to which Commonmealth legislation for control of narcotics rests on this power has been limited to which gives authority to the Department of Customs and Excise to control manufacture of narcotic alkaloids.
Imports and reports are controlled by customs with authority The remaining obligations under the Single Convention have been left in the hands of State Governments and Territory Administrations.
These obligations cover distribution down to retailers, doctors, chemists and include control over the cultivation of opium poppy.
n larch 1967 the government directed that a Commonwealth inters departmental committee ermine the long tem role of the Commonmealth in controlling traffic in and consumption of narcotic drugs and other drugs of dependence.
The government agreed to a subsequent recommendation of the committee that obligations under the Single Convention, other than control of imports, reports end manufacture, be left in the hands of State opium poppy as a noxious weed.

In addition to inspections by Health and Agriculture personnel the Tasmanian Police rug Squad in co-operation with the local police maintains general surveillance of the cultivated areas in order to discourage the presence of unauthorised persons.
The new method of harvesting, using a modified forage harvester, has greatly reduced the incidence of poppy heads left in the field and spillage of seed on the ground.
After harvesting the ''stubble'' is disc harrowed into the ground and any later germination of seed is harrowed out.

Representatives of the Department of Oustoms and Ircise and the N.S.W. Departments of Publio Health, Agriculture and Local CGovernment met in Sydney on 24 March 197l to discuss the proposed cultivation of opium poppy in New South Wales.
This company is concerned over the advantage it could lose to Glaxo in the event of not being able to produce opium poppy in Australia.
The meeting agreed that the matter should be submitted to The Ministers discussed the question of control of poppy seed and cultivation generally and resolved that the N.S.C.C. be asked to examine the matter mirth a view to arriving at a national approach to control.
The present meeting is being balled as a preliminary to H .S.C.C. consideration of the matter.
National Archives of Australia kl ft I am writing to request your assistance in the preparation of the National Standing Control Committee's report of the meeting of U March 7977 and its report to the Meeting of You will appreciate that the report of the recent N.S.C.C. meeting is also required for submission to the meeting of Ministers.
In the circumstance of limited available time, I have arranged for a member of the secretariat to telephone your office in the afternoon of Tuesday 16 March to obtain your suggested amendments, if any, to the enclosed drafts.
Yours sincerely, or er Acting Assistant Secretary, Department of the Interior, National Archives of Australia This report outlines the progress made by the Committee since the last they include reports papered by the Bducetion Snb-Commitee md by working parties of the Security Sub Committee.
The Report is presented under three broad headings: At the last fleeting of Ministers it was decided that Comonmealth and State laws be amended, mere necessary, to provide: .increased
penalties for drug offences; a separate offence of traffiolingvend possession be rima facie evidence of trafficking.
The folloning amotion has been taken to implement the abodes Nen South ales - appropriate legislation passed - has appropriate legislation in respect of penalties Victoria and trafficking.
Is examining question of Queensland legislation has been drafted South Australia - appropriate legislation passed Western Australia- legislation has been drafted .
Bill has passed Lomer House Tasmania Gomonmealth Legislation is being drafted.
This matter mas raised at the last meeting of liinisters.
A reviem of the provisions applying in States and the Territories revealed that these mere considered adequate in all but Queensland and Victoria.
These States are currently refilming their legislation and this aspect mill be considered as part of the reviem.
National Archives of Australia To further facilitate the high degree of eo operation and linin apparent in the field operations of Commonwealth end State meeting of ministers that Cstoms officers be made authorised officers Palioe has indicated that ths matter ie to be listed as a topoi for discussion at the net meeting of courses mare very musoesaful.

The coursa was considered to be highly guooessful both from the technical point of vim and for the opportunity it rrovidad for the change of ideas and improving of understanding betmeen Customs, expressed the ish that a further course of this nature be held.
National Archives of Australia The Committee examined this item having regard to the number of thefts from drug wholesalers and retail pharmacists and agreed that a serious problem heisted.
As a result Nem South ales and Victoria have promulgated regulations specifying minimum security requirements in respect of storage of dangerous drugs.
Other States are in the process of introducing similar regulations.
As an added safeguard chemists were requested to reduce their stocks of dangerous drugs to a minimum.
Chemists are co-operating and significant quantities of surplus and obsolete stocks are being handed in to the State Bealth Departments for destruction.
The effectiveness of moves to limit stocks held by retail chemists could be affected if packs of bulk drugs supplied to them by wholesalers are too large.
Accordingly the Committee proposes, for confirmation by ministers, that wholesalers be requested to introduce smaller packs where necessary.
A working party mas formed to examine (a) the adequacy of controls used when dangerous drugs mere transported within the country - both inter and intrastate, (b) the obligations placed on consignors, consignees and carriers to promptly report losses and (c) the most efficient means of co urinating and investigating cases which report loss during interstate shipment.
The working party presented an interim report describing the various forms of transportation used and controls which mere applied in each case.
The Comittee approved in principal the working party's request that it proceed to draw-up criteria for the security precautions which should be used for each separate form of transportation.
This work is proceeding.
National Archives of Australia i.8 Sunnly of Drums to Shins A second marking party mas formed to investigate security provisions laid down for dangerous dugs held on board ships.
The folloming major recommendations arose out of the working party's inspections and deliberations: (7) theta all supplies of dangerous drugs be made by licensed wholesalers or manufacturers and (2) that where orders for the replacement of old stocks are lodged, the supplier should replace the deteriorated stock on a one-for one basis and claim the old stock for supervised destruction at a later date.
Additional work is still to be undertaken and a further report mill be made in due course.
Heroin Stock In 1954 the Commonwealth placed a total ban on the importation of heroin.
Subsequently some States prohibited the use of heroin mile others deferred such action until stocks had been used up.
Some eighteen years have nom passed and there still appears to be relatively large stocks of heroin being held.
It mas agreed that the States concerned would actively examine the matter and report back to the next meeting.
At the last meeting liinisters accepted the Committee's recommend- tin that an rEducatin Sub Gomuittee be set up and that a special allocatin of funds for the implementatin of educatinal programmes approved by the N.S.G.G. be provided.

In respect of amphetamines and other like central nervous system stimulants it mas agreed at a meeting betmeen the Commonmealth Department of Health and the Customs Department in April, 1970, that there should be no further imports of amphetamine, dexamphetamine, methylamphetamine and phenmetrazine until importers could justify applications in view of the restricted usage of these substances for This decision mas taker in the light of e recommendation made by the irrational Health and medical Research Council.

Sir William thanked the Chairman and said that he welcomed the opportunity to be present at the meeting which for him had a tno-fold purpose, firstly to bring the Flaning Committee completely into the picture and secondly to receive advice from members of the Committee.
He said that to date two films had been produced and were ready for screening.
The first of these as ''The Acid Test'' mich had been made by Boby Limb and mould be shorn as a pilot introduced by Bobby Limb and 10, 000 discussion kits had been prepared and mere ready for distribution.
The second film ''Where are we Heading'' had been prepared by tre Commonmealth Film Unit and copies had been made and distributed to the States.
This film would be screened at the discretion of the States.
Sir llliem then outlined in general terms the activities and aims of the Drug education Sub Committee.
The Chairman stated that most of the recommendations of the Suh- Committee had been approved.
He considered that the important matters to be discussed mere in relating to expenditure during 1972-7 and proposals for l971-72.
Homever before going into this he wondered mhether there mere any questions which members missed to put to Sir William.
National Archives of Australia Det. Sgt, Abbott said that he would like to make it clear to Sir William that education was not the role in combatting the drug problem.
Thile the Comittee wes very conscious of the part that education mould play in the future, he considered it that it was necessary to work as a team and that other avenues also had to be supported.
He asked Sir William what age group in the schools the Sub- Committee was directing its education Sir Milliam stated that it was the intention to aim the programme at the Secondary School level.
He said that in Americe it mas aimed as low as the 10-12 age group, but at this stage it mas intended to keep mainly at the secondary school level.
He also said that he mas aware that education mas only one segment of a big problem which also included enforcement, and treatment and rehabilitation of addicts.
oodruf said that it should be bone in mind that a planned education campaign directed at children would naturally have to be prepared in a form suitable to children.
He wondered whether it mould be more .
appropriate to mark on the teachers so that they could apply the lessons to the various groups in the most appropriate form by virtue of their experience s es educationist.
This would of course be distinct from a consciously devised Sir glia greed and said that part of the programme was being designed with this in mind.
He mentioned the seminar which was being conducted at the present time and also stated that the film ''Where are me Heading'' was designed for this purpose.
He said that this was also a matter for the State Health and Education Departments to integrate in their om P dmendson then outlined details of the seminar being conducted and briefly indicated the background of the various people attending the RE nou commented that Western Australia would have liked to have sent a representative to the course but could not afford to release anyone for a period of six months.
he hairy stated that consideration would have to be given to the holding of a similar course next year.
In doing so the length of the course mould need to be borne in mind.
However he considered that it would perhaps be better to wait until the current course finished so that it could .
Hienholt advised that a report on the course would be made to the Education Sub Committee which would in turn pass it to this Committee.
He said the idee of the Course was to train personnel so that they mould return to their home States to train other people.
If the States felt that their omn training programmes mere adequate there would be no need to hold future courses of this nature.
he OQgira then said that the education Sub Committee had received a request for additional funds from Nestern Australia.
Eomever before dis- cussing this he considered it mould be appropriate to ask whether in fact the States mould have spent their allocations by mid-June.
He said that this information mas essential for txo reasons.
Firstly to assist in putting together a request to Cabinet for funds for 197l-72 and secondly to be able to consider western Australia's request for more funds.
The various representatives ave their opinions but undertook to examine the meter end mould have the necessary information then contacted.
The hairan then explained that there mere two requests for funds from Western Australia, one being for $10,000 to conduct an experimental part-time information centre and to conduct a training programme previously scheduled for 1971-72.
The other request was for funds to conduct a youth PE Emondson said that the youth seminar in Western Australia was planned as e pilot test with a vim to holding further seminars in the other States as a possible buildup to a national seminar.
The cost for the seminar in Western Australia mas expected to be 3,500.
The hare aid that it was necessary to consider this proposal today as it mas hoped to conduct the seminar early in April.
He said that the seminar would be a residential course with some fifty participants.
The Health Education Commission of Wiestern Australia would be providing its services free of charge.
He put it to the meeting that approval should be given for this project subject to funds being available.
National Archives of Australia s '9drulff eked whether these were the only specific requests for funds as it was necessary to get the complete picture.
The aide replied that there was one further approach and that was mirth regard to the ANU Research Froject.
The University wanted an undertaking that funds mould continue for the duration of the study.
He said that no such guarantee could be given since if there was a cut back in the grant from the Commonwealth some of the projects in the States may rate a higher priority.
He suggested that if money was available from this year'gs funds the whole amount should be allocated to the project.
He said that itmas impotent to be able measure and assess the results of projets undertaken.
In view of the difficult nature of this task he said he would support the proposal.
He then asked whether ean assurance could be given that the level of spending of this year's funds mould continue and that there mould be no ourtailnent of existings plans.
The Chagrgam said theEheGould give no assurance Pmemr he mas confident that funds mould be availhle to alley for continuation of eristic proposals.
He then put the proposition to the meeting.
It mas agreed that, subsect to funds being available, the $10.000 to Western Australia for training programme s 3.500 to Western Australia for youth semina The Chairman commented that the education Sub Committee had reported requests received from the States for 1971/72.
A doubt had also been raised as to whether there was any duplication in the area of research projects.
lienhold replied that in that regard the Gommonmealth Department of Health mas taking the necessary steps to ensure that the funds were not being used on duplicate projects.

Doxan commented that the figures in the report did not include e figure for Comonxealth expenditure.
He said it would be reasonable to assume that the level of ependiture for the coming year would be higher than for 1970-.71.
Moodruff asked mat basis was to be adopted to approve and equate the allocation of funds assuming that the Commonwealth grant was The Chairuan said that the Education Sub Committee would be asked to make an assessment in this regard.
Honever no derision would be made except R Pno said that the estimate from estemn Australia had not yet been examined end would probably be shaved comm considerably.
He also agreed with Dr. Hoodruff that the question of the basis of allocation should be considered in vim of the experience gained from the early allocations.
The ehairan stated that a very effective Sub Committee was non available to process matters such this.
He said that programmes had been commenced and would be supported.
He could only repeat that whatever funds mere avallable they mould be allocated by the rational Stending Control Committee.
He added that the submission to Cabinet would include full details of what had happened, mat it mas proposed would happen and the requirements of the States.
For this reason he proposed that the question of allocations for next year be left on the basis that work would be commenced on it immediately and that it may be necessary to follom matters up mirth the various States. .
Hiecintre raised the question of an overlap so far as funds were concemrned betmeen education on alcohol and drugs.
He said that at times it was impossible to separate the to.
National Archives of Australia r Nienholt stressed that Cahinet had specified that funds were being made available for drug education and it did not envisage the money being spent on other things.
He said that he was maare that it mas inevitable that there would be some minor overlap in this area which meany be allowed but he would not like to see any detectable movement of funds may from drug education.
He said it was realised that States must have a complete health education programme and to the extent that it involved drugs the Comonmealth Government had provided funds to help subsidise the drug education part of this programme. .
woodruff said that South Australia had e problem in respect of a budget for 1971-.72 in that they currently had an officer attending the training seminar.
He mould have the whole year ahead of him to do the things which he would be stimulated to do.
To this extent he felt they may have been conservative in their estimates for 1971-72.
The Chairman reminded members that thga tt for funds.
To do this it would be necessary to get as mch information as possible and it mst be realised that the information to be sought mas vital to allow a precise assessmeant to be made in support of the Cabinet submission for more He meant on to say that there were two other recommendations from the Education Sub Committee to be considered.
Ohe of these mas in respect of the film called ''The Choice'' for which funds had already been provided.
It mas agreed that the Commonnealth Film Unit should be he Oeirgan Said that in respect of the other recommendation relating to the desirability of having a second national training prorate he would suggest that a decision be delayed until such time as the States had been able to make an assessment of the current course and the situation regarding funds was RE. odruff agreed with this and suggested that possibly a refresher training course aimed at an exchange of ideas may be more useful than the es Oee ESSE Oecision or the holdiny of a second National Archives o The Chairan then commented that there mas some controversy regarding the P.. shorts as to whether two minutes was sufficient time or whether it mas too long.
Sir ilia outlined plans to form a Working Party of experts in this field to examine the scripts and report back to the education Sub.
Committee.
He said that he mas anxious to get these off the ground.
Dr, Woodruff said that he would like to see these before they were shorn as some P.V. stations were putting on shorts with some drug message which wes being misdirected.
lr esaen agreed that nettling should be sham publicly until it at least had the approval of the experts.
Pir ilia said that it was nit these points in mind that he desired to get the media people behind him so that they mould follow the course planned by the Education Sub Committee rather than go off at a tangent D, Wienholt drew attemion to the fact that the Sub Committee had already approved of ten scripts and that the Commonmealth Film Uhnit had entered into an arrangement to make these scripts at the rate of tmo a meelss from the beginning of April.
Irrespective of the findings of the Working Party these must be proceeded mirth.
The Chairman agreed mirth this and reminded members that not only did the money have to be spent, the public must see what it is being spent an effeotie organisation for dealing mirth the problem of drug education.
The hairy suggested that any effective discussion on the discussion on the results of the conference should wait until the final text of the proposed convention had been received.
He stated that no real difficulty mas seen in adopting the Convention since existing controls in Australia appeared to be more stringent than those required by the proposed Convention.
concerning the delegation from Australia.
It was stated that the members of delegation had acquitted themselves most admirably and had been better equipped than most other delegations.
Pr, Miienholt then drew the attention of the States to the fact that one problem arising from the Convention lay in the licensing of manufacturers and wholesalers under the provisions of the various health regulations.
He said that any additional requirements in this regard would be dram to their attention, and it was possible that some States would need te extend their posers.
He added that when the Convention became official a meeting of Commonmealth and State authorities mould be called to discuss.
PE. no wondered whether it would be possible to get some prior knomledge of the requirements of the Convention since Western Australia was on the verge of drafting nem legislation.
Hleholt replied that it may be some time before the final ratified version of the Convention yas released and in the meantime he suggested that ir, rots would be as knowledgeable as anyone in this regard.
The Ohairan advised that this report mas mainly for information only.
He said it also provided an opportunity for discussion or comment on the drug identification kits being prepared by the Customs Deprtmnent.
Patricke asked mhether the use of these Hits mould delay arrests by the police until the preconise identity of the drugs mas made.
The Chairman stated that the kits were merely an aid to help the man in the field to distinguish between say talcum powder and heroin.
It mould be necessary to refer the drugs back to the analysts for detailed identification.
He said that an officer of the Oustoms Department was currently visiting the States to instruct in the use of the kits.
National Archives of Australia The Chairman said that members would recall the discussion which took place at the last meeting in regard to this item.
He stated that he regulation specifying minimum requirements for storage of drugs and that Western Australia and Tasmania were in the process of bringing in similar requirements.
He then asked the States to comment bearing in mind that this mas a matter which would be reported to ministers when they met.
ME dimes said that the security requirements in New South Wales He said that there was close liaison mirth the police in this regard.
est abbott quoted figures relating to break and enter of premises during 1970 and 1971.
He added that all licensed premises had been specially examined by members of the rime Prevention Squad, and it mas anticipated that all premises would have adequate security provisions by lay.
NTe EOSa said that Victoria had much the same stringent requirements as Nem South hiales.
It had recently become compulsory for safes to be installed in pharmacies.
He added that as a result of this there had recently been evidence of a break and enter into a chemist shop but no drugs mere taken.
A period of grace of 2 months was being alloyed for chemists to install the safes.
REe Snon asked mat the provisions were with regard to hospitals. .
Rimes replied that they ere required to install safes, although it was not necessary for one to be installed in each mardy.
P toedruff said that recommendations to the government in South Australia had been accepted but had not yet been brought into operation.
They provided a period of grace of three months.
e trick said that the proposed regulations in Queensland included wholesalers, chemist shops and doctors and that a recent check of 34 pharmacies had sham that safes had either been installed or were on order.
He said they mere looking at the question of security in hospitals. .
snot devised that (amendments to the regulations had been prepared in draft form.
I the meantime steal safes mere being installed in pharmacies in 'lestern Australia.
R Hacintre said that appropriate legislation mas being promulgated in Tasmania.
s chairman then mentioned that the second aspect of this item related to stocks being held.
He said that he understood that Nem mouth ales and Victoria had met mirth considerable success in encouraging chemists to reduce their stocks of drugs.
It was revealed that other States mere also meeting mirth success in this regard.
r icCerth suggested that a further means of reducing stocks held by chemists mould be a request for wholesalers to pack their bulks drugs in smaller packs thus reducing the minimum peck quantity which a chemist may uumest that wholesalers be asked to ree the minimum .Reviem of legislation - Penalties he Cairman said that members would recall that Cabinet had agreed to the recommendations of ministers in respect to penalties for drug offences.
He stated that the necessary legislation mas currently being The situation in the States mas reported to be as follous: .
Bill had been passed and was lam examining the question of possession of prescribed quantities being prima facie evidence National Archives of Australia re of trafficking.
Bill had been drafted and about to go before Parliament S.A. Bill has been passed regulations Tas. Bill had passed lower House but not the Senate.
Possibility of some modification in regard to possession of prescribed quantities being prima facie evidence of trafficking.
Ehe CAairan then mentioned that the Commonmealth ma also considering further aspects in relation to penalties and some announcement on this regard ma be made at the ministers meeting.
Abbott said that in a recent decision handed comm in lem South ales it was held that in relation to the supply of drugs mens ria did not have to be established and theta reverse crus provisions applied.
The Ceirman stated that this item related to the decision of linistorg that customs Officers be made Authorised Officers under State legislation.
He said that there had been no change since the last meeting and the situation (a) Customs Officers have been appointed special Constables in South Australia and Western Australia Acts to allow Oustoms Officers to be appointed Authorised Officers (c) Hem South wales end Tasmania mere still considering the appointment of Customs Officers as Sspecial Constables.
chosen stated that the amendment to the Foisons Act would probably give the minister pome to appoint people as Authorised Officers rather than officers of the Commonmealth.
Nationa Archives of Australia The Chairan in introducing this item said that the minister for Customs and Ecise had asked that the matter be discussed in vim of the fact that some States still appeared to have not insubstantial stocks of heroin.
The use of heroin in these States is still leger and action to prohibit its use, etc. has been deferred until such time as existing stocks are used up.
B. Hienholt stated that three States still had stocks of heroin, Victoria, South Austrelia, and Tasmania.
Health also had an interest in this matter since a suggesting had been made that heroin movements should be monitored.
He added that there was of course a much simpler solution than Noodruff said that in South Australia heroin was no longer available from wholesalers to retailers.
Supplies are only made to Government hospitals and these halve been at the rate of about one salts every to years.
He added that there mas still very small but unspecified stocks mirth some retailers.
iiost retailers had however destroyed their stocks although this was not mandatory.
He Delieved that monitoring was not necessary and did not think the situation was such that it warranted complete destruction of stocks.
i ieCarth stated that Fauldings in South Australia had betmeen the substance mas being used for selected cases of terminal carcinoma.
He added that there mes very little in the trade and felt that most of the stocks were gradually coming under the control of the Health Department.
He also considered that he would have considerable resistance from doctors if he completely withdrem all stocks of heroin.
enholt asked what would happen men the stocks ran out.
eat abbott asked mat the life of heroin mas.
He suggested that stocks held in Australia must be at least eighteen years old and es such Could be therapeutically unfit for use.
He then outlined the problems which faced the Customs department in roving importation and said that uniform legislation National Archives of Australia PE woodruff stated that he appreciated the problem but he would not be prepared to challenge a medical cclleague who stated that a particular patient mas benefiting from the use of heroin.
He added that in any case other substances used in place of heroin such as morphine and other morphine like substances were not all that different from heroin.
tieeintre stated that he wes unable to state what quantities mere held in Tasmania.
Homever he did say that all existing stocks had been collected and were held by the Health Department.
Because of this it mas within their power to include a provision in the draft bill making heroin a prohibited substance.
is Eossn said that he would undertake to have the question actively The Chelman stated that the liinister for Customs mould probably raise the meter at the next meeting of ministers.
soodrufE said that he would ask the hospitals for up- to-date information on the frequency of use of heroin and its need.
the question of use of heroin and the Commonwealth would look speak to the paper which he had prepared on the matter.
P abbott said that the control over hypodermic springes and needles had been of concern to him for some time.
He had raised the matter on tmo occasions with the len South tales Foisons Advisory Committee.
This Committee had adioumned any decision pending a revien by the Hational Stending Control Comittee.
Be mas firmly convinced that steps should be taken to -He went on to say that to suggestions had been put forrard, one being for sale on prescription or other authority, the second being the introduction of legislation making it an offence to have possession of such an instrument for an unlamful purpose.
He added that he favoured adoption of the second method and stated that South Australia had in fact already introduced legislation along these lines.
aE lienhold end Aire ides both said that they would be opposed to control of syringes by way of issue of prescriptions mainly because of the problems they could see in respect of disposable syringes.
They felt that the key to the problem was to legislate for unlamful possession.
Mr Strutton said that the draft bill in Queensland also contained legislation along similar lines to that in South Australia.
PE ieeintre suggested that an important point to be considered in bringing don legislation mas to differentiate betmeen the addict end the The Chairman stated this problem was the same irrespective of mhether dealing with syringes or drugs.
he organ conceded that there mere points both mays and felt that the matter should be given e lot of thought before making a recommendation to liinisters.
He suggested that a sub- committee should be formed to discuss all the issues and come up with a proposition.
don considered the Committee should merely report to iiinisters the outcome of the discussion without making any specific recommendations.
Each State could then look at the problem and report back to the next meeting of the N.S.C.C.
he Thairman mentioned a proposal discussed at the last meeting.
This mas that Oustoms mould hold a second training course for drug inspectors early in 197l.
He said that because of current restraints on epartmtntal expenditures it would unfortunately be necessary to postpone arrangements for this course.
The Department would however look at the possibility of manning a further course at a later date.
Rr. lienhold recalled previous discussions on this matter and said that it had been further referred to the lienal Health Committee which had veins on the treatment and rehabilitating of drug addicts.
Eomever they had asked that the matter be kept on the agenda as it vas something that needed to be given continuing attention.
He said that the llental Health Committee considered that at this stage they did not have sufficient knowledge or esurience to home out mirth any firm proposition but thought that facilities should be built or set up in hospitals for treatment end rehabilitation.
st, abbott suggested that the lienal Health Committee be asked to consider the formation of establishments divorced from authoratative control to mention talks that suggested the most effective rehabilitation mas through organisations administered by cured addicts, on a similar basis to Alcoholics Pr Moodmff said that there were many different approaches to this problem.
He considered that an experienced group should be established which mould be responsible for a number of different methods of treatment.
In this mav some form of evaluation could be made.
He stressed whomever that such a group should comprise experts in the field.
PE Mienhlt said that the appropriate course of action would be to take back to the wealth larking Farty or one of the Sub Committers the vies put forrard by members and ask them to enquire into these areas and given is a statement on the possibilities.
HT san stated that he would like to see this matter dropped.
He considered that it was too wide for the libational Standing Control Committee and should be placed in the hands of an expert sub- committee outside the mental health group.
National Archives of Australia continue to look at the problem and report back to the Ni.H. li.R.C.
He believed that the Committee had been particularly honest in its reports to date and should be given the opportunity to consider the veins put forward by ir, e to sit in on one of their sessions and report on some of the recent findings overseas.
It mas agreed that the matter mould he referred back to the attention to the vires expressed by members and the inform Pr dmonison said that the question of uniform statistics revolved around the questionnaire form mich mas required to be completed in order to enable information to be forrarder to the Uhnited Nations as required under the Single Convention.
He said it was also important as a means of providing informatics for use by Australia's health authorities.
He also pointed out that there mere many different mars or collecting statistics and the ental Health Commnittee had been considering the problem for some time.
r lienhold considered that the United latinos questionnaire was a difficult document to complete and it mas unlikely that any country would be able to fill it in successfully.

The Chairan referred to paper which had been prepared on the abuse potential of poppy strap.
He said that because of the virtual lack of security in this area the problem could be a serious one.
The question to be decided was mhether or not poppy straw should be included in State R. liacintre then stated that Glaxo Australia had large stocks of poppy straw stored in Tasmania and that they mould soon be shipping these in containers to Port Fairy at the rate of about to containers each fortnight.
In view of this he considered that the matter was a national problem.
He said that Tasmania was legislating to have poppy strap declared a dangerous drug and felt that other States should consider taking similar steps.
Folloing discussion it vas reed that the question of the should be referred to the poisons ub-Oomittee of the The chairmen stated that the next meeting of liinisters was to be held on 26 larch in Sydney.

National Archives of Australia HEe Rimes brought up the question of research on Schedule 8 drugs.
Be said that he considered such research under approved conditions should be undertaken if it was not unreasonable.
He added that one problem which confronted them whomever was the fact that in some cases the Cromn mas the only legal possessor and therefore research on these drugs should be undertaken by the Health Department.
He stated that his Department had received a request recently from the University to undertake research on marihuana and he asked the vies of the meeting.

Dr. Edmondson advised members that a progress report would be presented at the next meeting.
The Chairman balled upon Mr. Healey to report on the situation in independent schools.
Mr. Healey pointed out that although he had received information from only 29 out of the possible 500 independent school, he felt that the material received was fairly representative.
It mey not require supplementing.
Mr. Bealey advised that a feats of the survey was that most schools were unaware of the resources available concerning drug abuse education.
He suggested that it would be desirable for a. compendium giving details of available resources to be circulated to all independent schools.
Mr, Healey considered that a comprehensive list of independent schools should be available through the Department of Education and Science.
Mr, Anderson assured the Sub Committee that the Department of Education and Science would make this list available.
The Chairman suggested that a mall Worling Party be formed to look at the information provided by Mr. Healey and the States.
This Working Party should be concerned with formulating guide- lines with regard to the most effective methods of educating children about drugs.
It would then be a matter for the States themselves to decide whether they should adopt these guidelines.
Members pointed out that all leducators were aware of the basic principles involved in teaching but many used different methods all of which were equally effective.
If a working party was formed, it should only work in terms of principles and ideas.
7.2.5 Mr, Anderson maintained that if planning of curricula in the schools was to be considered it would be essential to involve State Education Departments end independent school authorities.
The Chairman pointed out that it was a function of the Sub- Committee to advise the States concerning the most effective means of drug education.
T7.2.T Mr. Maley suggested that the Working Party would serve a useful function by: education should be based, and (ii) reporting on the difficulties of implementation of these principles to the Sub Committee.
It was agreed that a small working party comprising Mr. Bealey, Dr. Clements and Dr, Krister should look at the principles involved in drug educatin and prepare a document for circular- tin at the next meeting, or, if possible, prior to the inert Natinal Archives of Australia 7.2.9

alcohol was a very completer one but a problem with which people dealing with drug education were continually being confronted.
They felt it was the responsibility of this Sub Committers to express some views on the subject.
9.4 Dr, Dick pointed out that if the Sub Committee placed emphasis on drugs alcohol would fall into a forgotten area and it should be kept in mind that alcohol presents our second or third greatest social problem.
There is no valid reason why alcohol should not be considered when discussing the drug problem, other than it is a socially acceptable 9.5 It wag noted that the Alcohol Foundations had added drugs to their area of concern.
9.6 Dr. Dickr considered that in any drug abuse prevention programme it would be more effective to present a positive plan for living rather than condemning the present way of life.
Whan discussing a patter for living alcohol must be included, 9.7 The Chairman pointed out that there were various Committees and Associations already working on the problems associated with alcohol and that he considered that the uterus of reference of the Sub Committee as they stood at present did not include alcohol.

It is erected that the articles will be available by the end of January.
It is proposed to distribute them in a similar manner to the handbook, ''The Use and Abuse of Drugs'.
It was suggested that members look through past papers at the offers of assistance and comment at the next meeting.

It was suggested that the reprint should contain information on both rational and State controls erercised over drugs of dependence.
It was also considered by most members that the material in the new book should be of a lightly less technical nature and of easier comprehension by a wider section of the 14,2.
The Chairman emphasised the necessity for States and Territories to present budgets for their estimated expenditure during the 1971/72 financial year before the inert meeting of the National Standing Control Comittes which will be in March.
It was agreed that this information should be forwarded to the Commonwealth Department of Health for consideration at the next meeting of the Drug Education subcommittee.
State representativ es were advised that the information should be sent to the Commonwealth Department of Health no later than 15 February.

The Chairman advised members that Mr. Carmody, Chairman of the National Standing Control Committee had invited members of the Sub- Committee to be bis guests in Melbourne on Monday evening 22 February.
National Archives of Australia Because of growing governmental concern about the increasing use of narcotic and other dependence producing drugs in Australia, the Prime Minister requested thi.t a Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers be held to discuss the problems of drug dependence and drug trafficling.
It was agreed that the Commonwealth should place an emphasis on the importance of a concertos national approach to the problems of drug dependence and drug The first meeting of Commonwealth and fete Ministers representing and Interior and State Departments concerned with the problems of drug abuse was held in Canberra on 14 February 1969.
At this meeting, it was recommended that the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence be established to: (a) confider immediately the further steps that can be taken by the Commonwealth and States together to combat all aspects of the present drug problem in Australia including addiction, trafficking, treatment and education, and (b) to make recommendations to Ministers on legislation and administrative action which should be taken.
At its first meeting on 7 March 1969 the National Standing Control Committee set up the Baalth Working Party to consider interstate movements of Single Convention drugs and other drugs of dependence, education, publicity and the treatment of drug dependents.
The relevant committees of the Hational Health and Medical Research Council were also called upon to provide expert advice concerning the problems associated with drug abuse.
The Health Working Party met for the first time on t April 1969 and their recommendations provided guidelines for State and Territory drug education programmes.
During the following twelve months, States were encouraged to implement the recommended measures, but it became apparent that additional assistance was required from the Commonwealth.
On 3 April 1970, the National Standing Control Committee recommended the setting up of an Education Sub Committee to integrate, co- ordinate and advise on education activities on drug abuse.
This recommendation was endorsed by the Mesting of Ministers on Drug Abuse on 24 April 1970.
To support the States and Territories in developing their programmes, the Commonwealth allocated $500,000 for drug education programmes to the National Standing Control Committee dulling the 1970-7l financial year.
This money was to be allocated according to the advice and recommendations of National Archives of Australia The Drug Education Sub Committee comprising a number of prominent laymen and the principal health education offices from each State and the Commonwealth met on 28 September 1970 and accepted the task of planning and co-ordinating the National Drug Education Programme.
The Sub Committee agreed that to be effective, any programme should be fitted into the arising framework of education facilities which were in most cases jointly the responsibility of Bealth and Education Authorities in each State.
The National Drug Education Programme is based on the principle that drug education must be primarily concerned with living and the problems of living in a modern society.
The following objectives were recommended for a National Programme in relation to the States and Territories: (ii) to provide support and also complement State programmes, (iii) to evaluate State programmes and the total programme.
Prior to the establishment of the Drug Education Sub Committee, the need for training coulees had been stressed and two seminars on effective techniques for drug education personnel had been conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Health.
Recognising that there was still a paucity of trained personnel, the Drug Education Sub -Committee recommended that a training course of sir months' duration be held for people who were undertaking a leadership role in State programmes.
Arrangements have been made for this course to commence on 24 February in Sydney at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.
Further supportive and complementary activities recommended by the Sub Committee were: (ii) the provision of consultant services, educational aids (both written material and films).
(iii) the collection and interpretation of information about the various educational techniques used in the community concerning drugs, and the methods of evaluation, (iv) the encouragement of research into the most satisfactory way of teaching about the drug problem in schools.
(v) the development of roles for varidus sections of the community and the integration of the various groups activities into State programmes.
National Archives of Australia Two projects have been developed in relation to the national media programme: () the screening of a specially prepared film on selected television stations, at a time when State Health authorities have adequate follow-up services to cope with the demands arising from the screening, (ii).
the production and screening on television stations of shorts about the drug problem.
Arrangements had been made by the Commonwealth Department of Health to have an educational film for discussion groups comprising parent, teachers and youth leaders produced by the Commonwealth Film Unit.
Prints of this film, 'Where Are We Heading?'', will be available in February.
Another film which is for adolescent audiences is in production and should be completed in Jume this year.
Other written material is being produced so that a comprehensive range of informative pamphlets will be available for distribution and technical information bulletins will be published regularly as an aid to educators and others concerned with the problems of drug abuse.
Its Significance in the National Drug Education Programme .
At present, the Terms of Reference of the Education Sub Committee of the N.S.C.C. do not include Alcohol in the list of drugs for which the advice of the Sub Committee is sought.
2. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that an effective National Drug Education Programme cannot be developed without consideration being given to the possible role of alcohol as causal and related factors in the drugs problem.
3. Adolescents are cynical about the sincerity of Issue of sincerity (a) accepting quite heavy social drinking (b) condoning loss of control of heavy drinkers dangerous consequences of heavy prinking.

These challenges must be faced and cannot be brushed aside with a show of authoritaranism.

Epidemiologically, abuse of alcohol does far more individual and social harm than all non beverage relative drugs together.

Issue of 10.
There is some evidence that total availability and availability common usage influences recruitment to using drugs generally.
Alcohol is one of the largest categories iof regularly used drugs Any action to reduce total usage may be expected to reduce abuse.
Issue of 1. Attacking the high rate of alcohol usage means finding acceptable alternative behaviours.
These desirable alternatives would be just as relevant to non-beverage drug use.
Issue of 2. It is possible to see irrational application of the law to alcohol as distinct from non beverage drugs.
comparable This causes the drug law to be less highly regarded legal and makes it difficult to counter argument regarding criteria legal criteria of use and abuse of all drugs makes education infinitely easier.
Issue of 13.
There is a confused but, definite relationship between reasons for use of non-beverage and research relationships.
Collection of data for all forms of drug use and abuse would tend to clarify the individual and social factors.

National Archives of Australia 17.
There is a strong association between chronic heavy drinking in parents and early addiction to alcohol and/or drugs in the children 8. Officials of the American National Council on Alcoholism, claim that when parents drink in a cultured atmosphere, as part of a ritual and not just for fun or for the stimulating or mind- deadening effects, their children seldom become dependent on alcohol.
Studies made both in Australia and abroad have shorn that children raised in a home where adults, including parents drink purely for the pleasurable effects, for fun, for repeatedly revelry, are likely to follow their pattern and become either alcoholics or drug dependent.
The role of the parent as a model in this, as in other forms of behaviour, is obvious.
National Archives of Australia National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence.
Conference on Psychotropic Substances The Australian delegation comprised: Mr. G.E. Sheen, Assistant Comptroller General of Customs, Chairman of Delegation Alternate Chairman and Alternate Representative.
Mr. A.D. Brown, First Secretary, Permanent Mission of Australia to the U.N., Geneva, Alternate Seventy-one countries participated in the conference.: Australia was represented on the following committees: Central Committee.
Technical Committee.
Credentials Committee.
Australia was also represented in a number of working groups.
Dr Walshe chaired the group on the limitation of use to medical and scientific purposes.
The Conference decided that the instrument was of sufficient importance to justify it being entitled a Convention.
From the outset many delegations emphasised the need for wide National Archives of Australia acceptance of the convention.
There was a continuing atmosphere where the phrase ''spirit of compromise'' and ''need for universal acceptance'' were commonplace.
The rasult has been a convention where the provisions have been weakened when compared with those contemplated by the original draft Comments on the more significant provisions of the Convention are contained in the following paragraphs.
Schedules With the exception of theaddition of phencyclidine to Schedule 2 (transferred from Schedule 4) there has been nc change in the content of Schedules I, II and III from that which existed in the draft protocol.
As far as Schedule 4 is concerned six substances have been deleted from Schedule and one substance, phencyclidine transferred to Schedule 2. Substances deleted from Schedule 4 of the draft protocol are Chloral hydrate Paraldehyde Chlordiazepoxide The final schedules are as follows: other nonproprietary or trivial names are given only where no INN has yet been proposed.
List of Substances in Schedule I. INN Other non-roorietarv or trivial name.
Other non proprietary or trivial names.
PHENCYCLIDINE List of Substances in Schedule IV 1/ INN Other non proprietary or trivial names.
MEPROBAMATE SPA A proposal by Australia to have the following substances: Allobarbital referred to in the Seventeenth Report of the W.H.O.
Expert Committee as substances analogous to the substances included in Schedule III of the draft protocol, be added to either Schedule III or Schedule IV was rejected in the Technical Committee stage.
These seven substances from the list of 30 analagous substances are available in Australia and it seemed illogical not to include them when other barbiturates with a much less abuse potential are included in Schedule IV.
In its first consideration of the Schedules the Technical Committee recommended chlordiazepoxide and diazepam for scheduling in Schedule IV but in its final deliberations some three weeks later the Technical Committee deleted the two substances from the schedule although a number of countries including Canada, Australia and U.S.A. strongly resisted this move.
The Technical Committee proposed that precursors be covered by the protocol by the addition of a separate paragraph to Article 2 and a separate schedule.
This proposal was in line with the recommendation contained in the T7th Report of the W.H.0.
Expert Cemmittee on Drug Dependence However it was subsequently recommended by the Committee on Control Measures that precursors be omitted from the protocol.
Further to this the matter was raised in the Plenary and a new paragraph was added which, whilst not providing for any acts ual control of precursors under the Protocol, requires parties to apply ''such measures of supervision as may be practicable'' to substances which may be used in the illicit manufacture of psychotropic substances.
Special provisions regarding the control of preparations.
There has been no significant change from the draft protocol as far as the exemption of preparatinns from some measures of control is concerned.
New Substances.
In the original draft a party could, under Article 2, apply a limited right of rejection of decisions of the Commission to add substances to Schedule III and IV.
On the initiative of U.S.A. a limited right of rejection now applies to additions to Schedules I and II.
Australia vigorously opposed this proposal.
Most countries supported the proposal on the grounds that: a) it would permit more countries (particularly U.S.A.) to adopt the Convention, b) certain new powers had been vested in the Narcotics Central Board such as the power to require explanations from offending Parties; the right of rejection was only to be used in exceptional circumstances.
National Archives of Australia The partial right of rejection also includes the right not to require preparations for Schedule IV substances to be controlled - also opposed by Australia.
The criteria for adding new substances to the schedules was also modified.
The provisions originally contained in Article 2 paragraphs 4 d 5 have been reworded after considerable argument.
The criteria are now more clearly specified but are not precisely the words preferred by Australia, eg. the inclusion of the word 'dependence''.
However, it reflects a compromise between a number of delegations particularly Australia, U.S.A., Sweden, Argentine and India.
The Convention still maintains strict control provisions in relation to these substances.
However, on the initiative of U.K. these substances may be used for ''very limited'' medical purposes.
They may not be used for industrial purposes.
There have been some modifications in relation to the control provisions relating to the substances in Sehedules II, liL and IV.
These provisions include prescriptions, labelling prohibition of importation and exportation, international trade, statistics, report to the INC.B., records licensing penalties, illicit traffic and limitation for medical and scientific purposes.
These modifications are of not great significance but tend to soften the impact of the Convention.
Final Provisions.
The most significant change insofaras the N.S.C.C. is concerned, relates to the Reservation provisions.
A new party may notify any reservation.
Such reservations may not necessarily be accepted if a number of Parties object - Australia opposed this Adoption of the Convention.
The Convention would not seem to pose any real difficulty from the point of view of its formal adoption by Australia.
Existing controls in Australia would appear to be more stringent than those required by the Convention.
As soon as Copies of the Convention are available it is proposed that the statement be prepared setting out comments on each article.
Such a document could be made available to all interested National Archives of Australia MEETING OF STATE AD COMMONWEALTH ANALYSTS Agenda Item : Opening Remarks 7.1Dr.
Peters opened the meeting at 0 am., pointing out that it was opportunely timed to coincide with the Symposium on the Forensic Sciences.
The idea of a meeting of State and Commonwealth Analysts was originally suggested by Mr. L.G. Clark.
Its purpose is to discuss those aspects of the drug problem which concern analysts.
Agenda Item 2 : Standardisation of Analytical Procedures 2.1 There have been court cases which have demonstrated the need for preferred or recommended methods, in the absence of prescribed, legal methods.
It was pointed out here that in many cases of seizure Customs agents must lay charges under State law, because proof of importation is often difficult.
Dr. Samuel thought that in such cases the Commonwealth should pass on its information to the State police.
This is an area for Commonwealth-State cooperation.
2.2 Mr. Clark said that there was a need to rationalise analytical procedures.
It was agreed that qualitative methods are chiefly required and should be stand- advised first.
Mr. Lecky pointed out that in some cases legal levels are pre- scribed and must be proved, ie. in the case of barbiturates.
Mr. Henderson favoured the development and adoption of preferred methods, but did not want methods prescribed.
2.3 Mr. Clark suggested that methods used in the laboratories represented at the meeting, as well as comments on their efficiency, should be sent to a central clearing point.
Methods which do not work should also be reported.
Dr. Samuel suggested that the Commonwealth should start by circulating its own preferred methods for comment.
2.l Dr. Peters agreed that methods now used by the Customs Drug Section could be used as a basis.
The Customs Laboratories have decided to publish their general analytical methods in book form, the first volume to be issued shortly.
He offered this publication as a vehicle for the preferred forensic methods.
Mr. Clark thought that a separate publication was desirable.
2.5 The general Customs methods will be available to the public.
The question of the need of restrictions on forensic methods was therefore raised.
The problem could be met by classifying methods in two categories, - 2. Detective methods, which would be confidential.
In the Commonwealth Public Service, secrecy is covered by the Crimes Act.
Mr. Turner pointed out that the situation in the States was loose in this regard.
It was agreed that any initial exchange of methods should be in confidence and that the confidential character should be emphasized.
2.6 Dr. Samuel stressed that chemists give evidence in court as expert witnesses.
For this reason our methods must be available to the defence if necessary.
Mr. Lecky said that in queensland certificates of analysis are issued and admissible as prima facie evidence.
They are available to the defence.
National Archives of Australia guide for forensic drug analysis which will be flexible enough to allow chemists to cope with difficult analytical situations.
It was accepted that this guide should preface the methods for individual drugs.
A provisional priority list was then drawn up as follows: 1. Cannabis, including hashish and methods for individual 2.8 At the conclusion of the debate the following motion was passed.
''That the Commonwealth circulate to the States the methods they are currently using for the major drugs of abuse and request that the States comment on these as to their acceptability and add any methods of their own for either these drugs or any other.''
Agenda lItem 3 : Establishment of a Central Reference Library of Authentic Substances 3.1 The need for a centre which would acquire, hold and distribute reference samples of drugs was generally conceded.
The Customs Department, which must issue the necessary licences, is ideally placed to fulfil this function.
Dr. Peters said that the Commonwealth Laboratories would be willing to import for all Government laboratories.
The need was not only for drugs of certified purity, but also for authenticated plant samples.
3.2 The drugs would be issued following official letters of request.
The relevant State licence number will have to be quoted, and all other requirements of State laws will have to be complied with.
All requests must be sent to: Department of Customs and Excise, 3.3 At the conclusion of the debate the following motion was passed.
National Archives of Austalia ''That the Commonwealth act as the Central Reference Agency for authentic drugs, and that these be made available as and when Agenda Item 4 : Use of Drug Identification Kits by Police 4.1 Dr, Peters gave an outline of the uses and limitations of the kit.
The kits are clearly subject to limitations.
They are however useful because a positive result provides reasonable grounds for arrest.
Both Mr. Lecky and Mr. Turner said that spot tests carried out by police may be unreliable and lead to miscarriage of justice.
Drs Samuel said that no prosecution should be effected on the basis of tests performed with the kits.
The Customs Department has offered to distribute the kits to State police forces, and to provide one of its Chemists to demonstrate its proper use.
The offer has been accepted and Mr. Robin Barrett will visit the various States on the following dates: Sydney Adelaide Perth Hobart Brisbane Darwin Melbourne At a virtually convenient time.
It was suggested that Mr. Barrett should also visit the various Government Lab- oratories and that Chemists from the latter should attend his lectures and dem- inspirations.
The offer was accepted by all present.
The dates given above were .3
Dr. Peters then put three questions to the State Analysts: 7. Whether they are willing to receive kits themselves and maintain them, as well as those supplied to the police forces in their Statesa 2. Whether they are prepared to back them up (ise check whether seizures which have been tested by the police give the same result when tested by a Chemist, using 3. Whether they are prepared to report back the information obtained to the Customs Laboratories, perhaps on a quarterly basis.
This would enable Customs to evaluate All State Government Chemists were willing to cooperate.
,4 Dr. Peters asked whether other similar kits were available.
Mr. Crisp believed that there had been some in South Australia.
Some reagents had been prepared in N.S.W. to help as a sorting out test.
Returning to the lectures to be given by the Customs Chemist, Dr, Peters said that representative samples of National Archives of Austalia drugs
were available for demonstration purposes.
A number of papers on the kits and procedures for the performance of tests from the United States Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs are also available, and copies would be distributed to each of the participants.
Agenda Item 5 : Information Exchange 5.1 The possibility of a meeting of ''bench'' chemists to perhaps coincide with the next forensic science symposium, was again discussed.
Mr. Clark thought however that such a meeting should be held separately since not all concerned might normally attend the symposium.
Dre Samuel suggested to leave the matter in abeyance : there may not be a need for such a meeting.
5.2 Matters on which information should be exchanged include general intelligence; materials and services relevant to forensic work which are available in the various laboratories; new drugs or new forms of drugs which appear; and research projects which are in progress in the various organisations.
The suggestion was made that the Commonwealth Laboratories were well placed to serve as the centre for such an information exchange.
Accordingly the meeting passed the following resolution: ''That the Commonwealth should act as a central agency in receiving and disseminating information from the States on technical and analytical matters relating to drugs of abuse.''
Agenda Item 6 : Other Matters No points were raised under this item.
The meeting closed at pm.
National Archives of Australia National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence Heroin Stocks After consultation with various medical authorities and interested professional groups the Commonwealth Government, on the recommendation of those authorities, prohibited the importation of heroin absolutely as from 1 January, As a result of this decision New South Wales and Western Australia have prohibited the manufacture, use, ete, of heroin except for scientific purposes.
Other States decided to defer such action until existing stocks had been used up.
The matter is listed for discussion in view of the fact that some 18 years have elapsed since the ban on the importation of heroin and stocks are still being held in the country.
National Archives of Australia NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE ON DRUGS OF DEPENDENCE.
The functions of the National Standing Control Committee are to dissuade any form of drug abuse through the avenues of law enforcement, education and treatment.
Considerable progress has been made towards this goal.
At the last meeting of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence, the Chairman drew the attention of the committee to the lack of control over the sale of hypodermic syringes.
He sought advice in the light of continual evidence being collated about the misuse of this instrument by drug offenders.
If the situation was serious enough he felt that some form of recommendation could be made to the Commonwealth and State Health Ministers at their next meeting.
Owing to pressure of business there was an abstention of debate on this subject, but I undertook to make a submission about the subject matter at the next meeting.
I have not attempted to include defence measures against control over the sale of hypodermic syringes because I fairly accept argument that there are many legitimate uses for this implement in the fields of commerce, veterinary and Statistical information available from the Ne South Wales Drug Squad over the past three years indicates that 794 drug offerers used the hypodermic syringe as an implement of administration, compared with 1,546 oral takers of the drug.
This comparison shows that 334% of the persons detected used the hypodermis syringe which warrants the need for some legal control over its use.
I have witnessed the deleterious results arising from the sadistic misuse of a hypodermic syringe readily available through the media of pharmacies, medical practitioners and auctions.
I respectfully suggest that the main consideration for central over this implement is to dissuade young people from graduating to hard drugs through its use.
From practical experience I have noticed that drugs of addiction are invariably administered by this means.
Questions about the uncontrolled sale of hypodermic syringes have often been directed by members of te public which resulted in me raising the issue be- fore the members of the New South Wales Poisons Advisory Committee.
However, this committee has adjourned any decision on the matter pending a review by the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence.
t is my belief that control over the sale of hypodermis syringes should be introduced and that at the time of sale a prescription or an order form should be presented by the purchaser, signed by an authorised person.
lr this suggestion does not meet with your approval I would like you to give further con nitration to a proposal that current Legislation be amended to make it an offence to unlawfully use a hypodermic syringe or similar instrument for the administration of a drug of addiction.
If adopted, similar provision to that NationalArchives of Australia relating to the possession of smoking utensils for the inhalation of Indian Hemp could be drafted.
In support of the submission set out herein I would like to draw the attention of this committee to the provisions of Section 5 of the South Australian Legislation - The Narcotic and Psychotropic Act 1934 to 1970, which reads as follows :- ''Any person who has in his possession any pipes, syringes or other utensils or any appliance or thing for use in connection with the preparation, smoking or administration of any drug to which this I cannot envisage that any great hardship would be created if control of this nature was introduced over the sale or use of hypodermic syringes.
If these submissions are rejected, then at least this committee can take comfort in the fact that the subject matter has been examined and a permanent reference to this fact included in the minutes.

National Archives of Australia Treatment and Rehabilitation At the meeting of the National Standing' Control Committee on 7 March 1969 it was recommended that a Working Party be established under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Department of Health to consider among other matters, the treatment of drug dependence.
The Mental Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Hesearch Council was approached for advice regarding treatment and rehabilitation of drug dependents.
The Committee recommended: ''Separate units specialising in the treatment of drug addicts and alcoholics be established in each State.
These facilities should be organised within the Staste Psychiatric Health Services and should provide inpatient, outpatient and intensive At a meeting of the Health Wlorking Party on 1 April 1969 the above recommendation was amended to: Facilities should be organised within the taste Psychiatric Health Services and should provide inpatientoutpatient and intensive follow-up arrangements.
The treatment of drug dependency as distinct from primary prevention is a medical matter and programmes of treatment by non medical agencies should be discouraged and should not be associated with youth This recommendation was put before the meeting of the rational Standing Control Comnmittee on 11 April, and, on e majority vote it was decided that the wording of the Working Party recommendation should be altered.
Subsequently the following recommendation was adopted: 1(1) Facilities should be organised within the State Health Services and should provide in-putient/out-patient and intensive follow-up arrangements.
The treatment of drug dependency as distinct from primary prevention is a medical matter, and programmes of treatment by non- medical agencies should be discouraged.
(2) Legal provisions for the compulsory detention of drug dependents should be made under health legislation rather than criminal legislation.''
At the Health Norking Party meeting on 19 March 1970 it was agrsed that the follouing recommendation be Submitted to the l.S.C.C. ''In the absence of precise information on treatment and rehabilitation services throughout Australia, the Health working Party recommends that as part of an overall research programme, an investigation be carried out into these facilities in each bate to determine the situation, bearing in mind the study currently being conducted in New mouth tales.'
This recommendation was endorsed by the National Standing Advice was sought from the Mental Health Committee regarding appropriate persons or organisations to undertake these investigations in each State and the manner in which such studies could be most effectively and conveniently undertaken.
The Mental Health Committee provided the following advice: ''The most appropriate organisations for obtaining and evaluating information on treatment and rehabilitation services for drug dependency in each State would be the State Departments of The Committee noted that investigations had already commenced in Victoria as from 1 January 1970 and information was being maintained on a computer system by the Victorian Mental Health Authority.
New bout Wales has already examined the need for services for the compilation of statistical information.
Western Australia has no special personnel to evaluate the problem and investigations are being carried out on a global basis.
The matter has been further referred to the Mental Health National Archives of Australia At the melting of Commonwealth end State Ministered on i4 Februar 1969 attention was drawn to the serious lack of reliable statistics on the size, incidence, distribution and patten of drug abuse in Australia.
The National Standing Control Committee on 7 March 1969 requested that the Mental Health Committee consider the collection of information on and research into drug dependence at its meeting on 27 end 26 Narch 1969.
The Mental Health Committee considered that a programme was necessary to collect information about persons found to be dependent on drugs in Schedule 8 of the Uniform Poisons Schedules, hallucinogens, amphetamines and allied psychos stimulants, barbiturates and also drugs with similar actions.
It was recognised that the enormus legal traffic in barbiturates might overload any system collecting information about the distribution of drugs of dependence.
The Committee considered that multiple cause coding of the causes of admission for psychiatric treatment would be necessary to identify all patients with drug dependence, because in some cases, drug dependence would be a secondary and not the primary diagnosis.
Hormally, only the primary diagnosis is coded and tabulated.
It was recommended that this and other technical problems relating to mental health statistics should be studied by a small reference committee.
Terms of efference and membership were recommended for consideration by Council in lay The Hental Health Committee also pointed out that there was a need for enquiry on a broad sociological basis into the psychological, economic and cultural factors associated ith drug dependence and also recognised that it would be very difficult to obtain the necessary data on a reliable basis.
The Committee agreed to keep this matter under reviex.
The National Standing Control Committee at its meeting of 1 April ''A programme is necessary to collect information about persons dependent on drugs in Schedule 8 of the Uniform Poisons Schedules, barbiturates end also drugs with smiler action in the list of Prohibited Substances as defined and/or listed in Uniform Poisons National Archives of Australia ''Medical authorities including private practitioners should assist law enforcement agencies as far as practicable in tracking don illicit sources of drugs., Patients should be encouraged to co- operate with the law onforcoment agencies on a voluntary basis, Eowever, medical practitioners should not be obliged to make names of drug dependent patients available to Police and Customs authorities.
It was considered that information given to e central authority about patients dependent on drugs should not be readily available to law enforcement agencies as it would dis-.
courage patients from seeking and continuing treatment.''
The National Hlenlth and medical Research Council at its Sixty-eighth Session endorsed the recommendation of the mental Health Comnmittee regarding the establishment of the ad hoc Mental Health Records Sub Comittee to which certain technical problems relating to Mental Health Statistics had been referred.
statistics of drug dependence submitted to the U .. would be copilot on the basis of the definition of dependence contained in the ''Glossary of mental In preparing Australia's Amnual Report to U.N.0.
for 1969, the same difficulties were experienced as in previous years in compiling the necessary statistics of addiction: (a) lea South Hales statistics are compiled on a differont basis to the other States and it is not possible to prepare statistics for Australia as a whole; (b) In some States apparently different criteria are used by Health and Police in determining who should be included in addiction statistics; (c) There appears to be no mean of ensuring that drug dependent persons are not counted twice.
There is an obvious need for collation of information on drug for the following purposes: a) to provide information for use by Australia's Health authorities, and (b) to enable statistics to be furnished to U.N.0, as required under the Single Convention.
A report from the Hental Health Records Sub Comittee was recoined recommended that Council approve the use, where necessary, by all States and Territories, of the attached uniform statistical collection form Appendix I).
Council approved this recommendation at its Seventy first Session.
The matter has ben further referred to the Mental Health Comittcs meeting to be held on 2 and 3 March 1971.

States were phased in as follows: Victoria, Tasmania South Australia Queensland Western Australia New South Wales, Australian) Capital Territory (There are no licensed formulators or wholesalers of Schedule 8 substances in the Northern 1.2
During January 1971 the monitoring system was extended to cover the phenmetrazine.
Due to differing State Poisons Schedules, the movements of methylphenidate are not monitored within Ne South Wales and neither methyl phenidate nor phenmetrazine movements are monitored within Victoria.
1.3 To enable the movements of methylphenidate to be monitored in the the sole Australian importers, agreed to report to the system all sales to wholesalers and distributors.
original reporting authorities have relinquished their licenses to deal i Schedule substances, and nine 9) new reporting authorities have entered the system, five (5) as a result of the extension of the system to include the amphetamines.
The total number of reporting authorities is now 222.
1.5 Transaction volumes have been found to be very near the original estimate of 32,000 per month.

For the firs time, the stocktak was under the control of State Health National Archives of Australia 2.2 The end-of-year stock balances are being used to reconcile, and adjust where necessary, computed stock balances.
On completion of the reconciliation, the quantities of base drugs available will be computed.

3. Health Wforking Party on monitoring The Sub forking Party held a meeting with representatives of the National Council of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries, in Sydney, on 8 December 1970.
This meeting was followed by a Sub Worling Party meeting on the same day.
Copies of reports of both meetings are attached as Appendices A and B. 4.1 Preliminary system design action is being undertaken by the A.D.P. Branch of the Commonwealth Department of Health with the object of incorporating the following modifications and additional facilities in the monitoring 4.2 Routine Reports 4.2.1 At present, routine movement reports list drugs by drug, form, strength, brand and pack size.
To make these reports more meaningful and easier to use, it is proposed to disregard brands and pack sizes and group all drugs of the same form and strength together.
Thus, the report as modified would show the total number of ampoules, tablets etc, of a drug, form and strength supplied to or received by a firm, institution or individual.
However, reporting authorities would still continue to report using a code denoting brand 4.3.1 Instead of providing all States with a monthly print of all movements, the proposed exception reporting modification will list only those movements where the quantity involved exceeds a predetermined marimum level.
In arriving at the marimm level, consideration would be given to the drug involved as well as the type of trading conducted by purchaser i.e, wholesaler or retailer.
4.4.1 Requests by some States for details of purchases by non- reporting authorities have already been received and satisfied.

Dash if there mas any likelihood of the number of reporting Mr. Dash replied that it was not likely as it is sometimes preferable to have a large number of reporting authorities in order to cut don distances Schedule 8 substances have to travel from wholesaler to retailer and to permit retailers to operate without the requirement to carry excessive stocks of Schedule 8 drugs.
The Chairman advised that it will soon be possible to provide special computer prints of details of purchases of individual pharmacies and other non-reporting authorities.
He said it was hoped to be able to provide these prints in accordance with a previously communicated inspection program and on an ''ad hoc'' basis.
Working Party members were keen to recurve such a service and agreed it would be a most useful product of the monitoring system.

Agenda Item 3 National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence.
Conference on Psychotropic Substances The Australian delegation comprised: Mr. G.E. Sheen, Assistant Comptroller General of Customs, Chairman of Delegation Alternate Chairman and Alternate Representative.
Customs Excise, Alternate Representative. of Health, Tasmania, Alternate Representative.
Mr. A.D. Brown, First Secretary, Permanent Mission of Australia to the U.N., Geneva, Alternate Seventy-one countries participated in the conference.
Australia was represented on the following committees: Control Committee.
Messrs Sheen and Mackenie,general provisions.
Technical Committee.
Credentials Committee.
Australia was also represented in a number of working groups.
Dr. Walshe charted the group on the limitation of use to medical and scientific purposes.
The Conference decided that the instrument was of sufficient importance to justify if being entitled a Convention.
From the outset many delegations emphasised the need for wide National Archives of Austalia ABUSE POTENTIAL OF POPPY STRAW 1.
The conclusions reached at the Ith Session of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs in 1963 reiterate the findings of the 796 Conference on Narcotic Drugs, vi.
''Poppy capsules cannot produce or promote addiction'.
2. Such conclusions relate specifically to the complexity and cost of the manufacture of morphine from poppy straw which manufacture requires large quantities of raw material and large factory premises; all of these factors combine to render illicit manufacture of morphine prieticanly impossible.
3. The potential of poppy starw for abuse relies not only on the manufacture of morphine, which is admittedly negligible, but also on the manufacture of the alkaloids (such as heroin) and on the consumption of the raw star. .
Historically there is no doubt that the soporific and narcotic properties of poppy straw were appreciated for centuries before the discovery that the much stronger opium is obtainable from the latex df the poppy head at a specific stage of the plant's growth.
It would appear that with the discovery of opium the use of infusions of poppy straw declined in favour of the more potent opium; this would account for the paucity of reports of cases of addiction to poppy heads.
Such reports do exist and the clinical effects of poppy straw addicition to Asian material are mell described by Chopra and others.
Significant differences in effects are that the excitement stage is more pronounced and the depressive stage is less than with opium.
In all other respects the effects resemble those of opium.
These differences are due to the higher narcotine content of the Asian 6. Poppy heads contain variable quantities of opium alkaloids.
The morphine con tent of overseas poppy straw seldom rises above O.6%. with a mean value of 1.0% morphine, with only a small amount of other alkaloids.
This means that the straw is approximately equivalent in morphine content to 8. The high actual morphine content, and the high morphine content relative to other alkaloids is probably due to breeding, so the seed distribution must be 9.
The morphine is concentrated in the capsule wall and the amount debases down the stem.
Seeds and dried leaves of the plant contain no detectable alkaloids.
Hwever, green plants contain opium alkalpids throughout the stems, leaves and Methods of Abuse on (known as Post in India).
The straw may be soaked in water and the liquid drunk.
2. Cheeing In the Indo-China area the heads are chewed. .
broking The straw may be smoked in a pipe.
Short stemmed pipes give a ''Burnt'' tongue so it is normal to use a water cooled or long stemmed pipe.
Work National Archives of Australia done in Melbourne indicates that 85% of the morphine will be inhaled with the lR This comes from the green plant and is not considered important in this context, as mentioned above.
5. Extraction of alkaloids or conversion to heroin, Work done in the Melbourne Customs Laboratory has shorn that heroin can be produced under ''crude kitchen'' conditions.
The yiald of heroin ranges from 60% under the crude con dictions to 95% under controlled condictions.
The material is straw coloured to white depending on the care taken, and would be readily saleable.
Tasmanian poppy straw has a definite abuse potential.
2. With the increased tendency for youth to experiment with drugs of all sorts it is surprising that the abuse potential of poppy straw has not yet been discovered.
3. The presence of poppy cultivations adjacent to public roads in Tasmamia as described by Mr. Potts would seem to be inviting early public discovery of the undoubted abuse potential of poppy straw.
It would appear desirable to curtail present guided tours of the poppy fields and to remove from circulation all posters and other material advertising the presence of the fields. .
It is considered that there should be strict but discrete control measures over both crop and production. 5.

OPENING OF MEETING and welcomed lMr, K W, Browmn of the Media Council of Australia, who Was attending in his place.
2. REPORT OF LAST MEETING The report of the meeting of 18 January 1971 was accepted.

It was noted that participants' kits in large quantities would be available by the beginning of larch.
It would then be possible to distribute the complete discussion kit to accompany the film.
Members examined the sample participants' kits and agreed that they would prefer to have the sheet with the photographs of the cast loose but trimmed to a size to fit inside the book.
The summary should also be stapled in the book.
3.2.1 Copies of the second script entitled, ''The Gate Crashers'', were submitted by the Commonwealth Film Unit and circulated to members.
Dr. Clements indicated that the Director who lad been allocated by the Commonwealth Film Unit to ''The Choice' had maintained that he would be unhappy about making the film asti was a documentary type.
The Commonwealth Film Unit had suggested that we should consider another type of sept with emotional content.
Miss Brooksbank (the author of the original script) script, ''The Gate Crashers''.
The Chairman asked members to read the script during the period immediately after the lunch break when discussion concerning the film would continue.
After lunch, members agreed that if the object of the film was to promote discussion, ''The Choice'' was more suitable than ''The Gate Crashers'.
All States indicated that they preferred the script, The Choice'' as it was basically a better film for their purposes.
be advised that a fin should be Produced from the fret scriPts 4.1 Members were advised that arrangements for the training course for State and Territory personnel undertaking leadership roles in the field of drug education were well under way and the time table for the first term was completed.
The Queensland representative advised that there would not now be a nominee from that State.
Nembers were informed that the number now attending would be eight.
4.2 Dr. Clements circulated a paper giving details of the programme for the 4.3 Members agreed that it should be decided as soon as possible in this year whether there would be a course in 1972.
States and also the Armed Services had indicated that a fairly long period of notice was necessary in order to make appropriate arrangements for representatives to attend the course.
It would also be necessary so that requests for funds, both by the States and the Commonwealth, could be included in the budget for 197/72.
National Archives of Australia 4.4 Members recommended that the desirability of having e similar training course in 1972 should be brought to the attention of the rational Standing Control Committee.
States and the Armed Services had indicated a further need for a course for personnel in 1972.
the film.
''The Acid Test'' 5.1.1
Members were advised that ''The Acid Test'' in its revised form had been received and had been seen by the Prime liinister.
He had indicated that he believed it was not the kind of film he should introduce.
The A.C.T. Health Services were arranging for film to be showman by Channel but as yet no decision had been made about the time of the screening.
(The screening has now 5.1.2
Members agreed that two aspects were involved in the pilot test.
The reaction of the public to the film should be gauged and public acceptance of the kit evaluated.
meeting of their senior officers to discuss these matters on 5.1.4
The Chairman assured members that each State would have the responsibility for deciding whether ''The Acid Test'' should be shown locally.
It was proposed to show the film to members of the National Standing Control Committee at the meeting on 4 larch.
Members agreed that it would be advisable for the A.C.T. Health Services to make some arrangements to survey audience reaction and to use the regular audience measures.
Public interest would be further measured by the numbers asking for discussion kits, group discussion leaders and other assistance.
It was considered that one of the purposes for which the pilot test had been planned was to determine whether the film should be used widely.
If it had material which would have a wrong effect on people then there should be some measure of this.
5.2 Discussion kits It was noted that the general discussion kits had been received and were ready for distribution.
5.3 Production of television shorts and discussions with Media 5.3.1 Members were informed that ten scripts were being produced by the Commonwealth Film Unit and that the first short would be available by the end of March or the first week in April.
The others would gradually begone available folloving this.
The Media Council representative advised that because of commercial commitments, television channels find shorts of two minutes' duration difficult to place during peak times.
Sixty.
seconds or thirty seconds shorts would be an acceptable length.
Paid or public service aspects were not involved, only the physical ability to place the two minute shorts.
that it would take twenty seconds to get an appropriate message across, there had to be provision for two frames at the end of the short so that it would be difficult to put over an arresting piece of material in forty seconds.
shorts were alerting mechanisms only and no message in terms of education was necessarily involved.
States indicated that they would prefer not to have an onslaught of requests for assistance from Health authorities but rather a steady diffusion of these 5.3.5 Mr: Healey considered that it would be a good idea to try to reach the adolescent so that the adolescent himself could be involved in getting information.
The Nedia Council representative advised that it would be possible to get exposure for two minute shorts on late night programmes, women's afternoon sessions and during Saturday and Sunday after- 5.3.T Dr. Clements suggested that the National Training Course participants
could, as an exercise with Miss Brooksbank, try to evolve further ideas for shorts of sixty seconds duration.
The Chairman advised that he considered these matters would be appropriate for consideration by a Working Party of experts.
He believed that two areas should be considered by the Worling Party, Media coverage and the role of the Media in playing dow undesirable statements made by purportedly authoritative persons.
It was intended that the proposed Working Party should wok directly under the guidance and control of the Drug Education Sub -Committee.
The Chairman with the assistance of Mr, Brown and Mr., Osborne could suggest appropriate membership of a Working Party and set out its terms of reference.
The Chairman advised that he believed that undesirable statements about drugs should be replied to quickly and correctly.
The other side of the case should be put to the public.
5..1 The Media Council representative provided the Sub Committee with details concerning the structurer and functions and powers f the National Archives of Australia 5..12 It as agreed that the Sub -Committee had a role in the provision of information for the Media so that it could be better informed about the drug problem and drug education.
Members agreed 'that the main obiective of the Workding Party should be to define areas of co-operation and mutual assistance with the Media and report its findings to the Drug Education Sub-Corittee.
The Chairman agreed to be responsible for submitting draft terms of reference to the Drug Education Sub -Committee members for approval immediately they were evolved.
The possibility of statements by the subcommittee being made to the Media on a national level was discussed.
members indicated that they considered it was the responsibility of each State authority to establish and maintain contacts with each individual unit of the Media.
It was noted that there were different constraints in individual States.
Miembers considered that the Sub Committee did not have the power to make replies as it was not within their terms of reference.
The Sub Committee was bouin by the terms of reference laid dow by the National Standing Control Committee.
If a change was sought, it would be necessary to go to the National Standing Control Committee to have the terms of reference reviewed.
The A.C.T. Working Party formed to supervise the Project had advised that the Australian National University had requested a definite indication that funds would continue for the duration of the study.
They required a definite undertaking before they could advertise for a research fellow to take up the appointment.
The sum of S6,967 was requested in 1970/7, S18,100 for the second year and S22,500 for the third year.
The Sub -Committee agreed that the attention of the National Standing Control Committee should be drawn to the desirability of supports this project until its completion.
The Sub Committee believed that if possible an undertakings should be given to the 6.2 Reoort of Working Party on 6.2.1 The Westemn Australian representative reported that in his State they had been working on a syllabus for drug education in schools.
The Report of the Working Party on Principles of Drug Education was noted and it was agreed that it cculd not be used in its present form as a request of the Sub Committee.
Nembers agreed that there was a need for schools to know the resources which were available in relation to drug education in the individual quantities by the Commonwealth Department of Health using an amended Report of the Working Party and including a section concerning sources from which schools may obtain further information and assistance.
Assistance in having the document distributed to all secondary schools, State and independent, should be sought from State Health and State Education 6.2.4
It was agreed that the Department of Education and Science should draw the attention of State Education authorities to the presence of this document.
The Queensland representative T7.

7.3 The Sub Committee recommended that the National Standing Control Committee be advised that they approved a further allocation of S10.000 being made to Western Australia subject to funds being available.
8.1 The State budgets submitted for 1971/72 were noted.
The following requests for funds were made: New South Wales $148,000 Victoria Queensland South Australia Tasmania Members discussed the basis on which funds would possibly be allocated B.2 Members agreed that it would not be desirable to have research projects duplicated by different States and that this should be one point to be watched in the budgets.
8.3 Some members obiected to the proposal by Victoria for funds for the provision of medical officers in training colleges.
8.4 Hembers considered that first priority should be given to continuations of programmes funded for 1970/77 and that the States should be obliged to indicate new items in their budgets.
National Archives of Australia A 8.5 Members considered that funds should be allocated for additional programmes only and not for normal growth increases in programmes, the financing of which should be State responsibilities.

REPORT OF WORKING PARTY ON INVOLVEMENT OF INFLUENTIAL SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY IN DRUG EDUCATION 10.1 The Working Party reported that letters of introduction had been prepared by the Department and forwarded to State and Territory Health contacts.
Letters had also been sent to specific service groups.
The next step was to arrange meetings with the State and Territory contacts in order to discuss the planning of seminars, etc. 10.2 Approaches had also been made to business organisations to ascertain their views regarding programmes.
The Sub Committee was advised that the business concerns which had been approached in Melbourne and Sydney had agreed to allow their theatres to be used for educational programmes for their employees.

A DRUG EDUCATION SUB COMMITTEE It may b assumed at the present time that the great majority of young pecple in schools and universities are untouched by the taint of drug dspendence and, indeed, may not even be interested in it.
However, young people in adolescence and in the period of transition from adolescence to adulthood are interested in experiment, and drugs may be resented to them as an interesting experience.
Moreov'r young people enjoy activities with an element of risk, making drug-taking, like cigarettesnoking perhaps, a symbol of Many educators are aware that making too much of a particular problem in isolation or with undue emphasis on certain aspects of the problem may actually encourage rather than diminish erperiment.
Mt if an educational institution accepts the personal growth of the student as its responsibility, then education about drug abuse can be viewed as part of the general programme for providing sstudents with information, which will assist them to develop helpful attitudes relevant to the problems encountered in achieving maturity.
This process, having begun within the family, continues in the primary school, and is accelerated in the secondary school.
Some esurience in the U.S.A. Suggests that where an effective drug education programme has been in operation in a school there is less drug abuse than in comparable schools without such a programme.
We are faced with a complex of factors which one educator rather depressingly summed up as being composed of hedonism, affluence, loneliness, gregariousness, lack of ambition or an excess of it, disappointment or anticipatory fear as to careers or jos, dissatis- faction or unfamiliarity with the cultural and sporting interests that could absorb young people's energies, contempt for the experience of elders, unsatisfactory family relationships, and loss or lack of religious faith or attachment.
National Archives of Austalia A Many educators therefore believe that they must tackle the problem of drug abuse within the context of other social evils, recognising that the problems of excessive drinking of alcohol and cigarette smoking may be more immediately serious, since the social attitude which promotes heavy drinking seems to be an integral part of the male role, which in turn may encourage a psychological environment in which progression to drug-taking may become a fashionable duty, especially since it ray appear less harmful initially.
ior can they isolate these social compulsions from the increasing est for fast car-driving, with which may be associated the two quite opposite with sexual gratification.
Educators, therefore, find themselves having to deli with the whole problem of physical, mental and oral health, and they must be careful to ensure that the structure of their whole programme keeps all these problems in reasonable relationship with one another.
They will wish in their teaching to treat the problem of drugs dependence as part of a total picture of personality-analysis, and to include education about drugs within a comprehensive programme of health education as a component of education for living.
For young people must be enabled to appreciate the differences between the intelligent use of drugs and drug-abuse, in living a healthful life.
Since we have not a single national system and since the education of the personality is not confined to a single phase of the process of education, it must be emphasised that the following recommendations are confined to the provision of practical aids and to the suggestion of certain principles.
A. Each educational authority or institution will of course choose its ow method of dealing with the problem.
This may be done through formally prescribed Health and Physical Education Courses, such as already exist under some State authorities, or by diluted instruction through related subject areas such as the Social Sciences, Religious Education, General Studies, General Science or specialist courses such as Biology, or any combination of such educational activities-
Where the system of diluted instruction is adopted it is usually thought desirable for a senior teacher to be responsible for co- ordination of the health topics.
The appointment of an adviser in health, including drug use, to visit schools and to arrange appropriate in-service training or provide resource materials has much to commend it, for teachers who are to deal competently with a health and social problem such as drug use and abuse must themselves be well informed.
The services of Health Departments are often available, but teachers may be unaware of the State resources available.

Already a number of TV ''shorts'' of general appeal are being produced.
C. Various aids have been produced, such as booklets, pamphlets and films which should assist those concerned in drug education.
There are also training courses available for group leaders, teachers and others who are active in this field.
For details on how these aids and assistance can be obtained, you should contact the address in your State or Territory given belon: N.S.W. Division of Health Education, Department of Health, Department of Health, Gregory Terrace, Brisbane.

Health Education Section, Commonwealth Director of Health, National Archives of Australia A D: The following principles in regards to education about drugs are recommended: at promoting individual happiness and sense of purpose, not merely s at prohibition.
It has been repeatedly demonstrated that attempts at persuasion based on high fear appeal or on exaggerated claims are generally ineffective, and may produce the opposite effects, especially where the audience is intelligent, critical and possessed of a considerable degree of information on the topic.
(2) Education should emphasise that the human being cannot be happy unless he is a member of society, which involves a certain surrender on the part of the individual to the needs of others.
Duty to self, in health as well as in morals, is therefore inseparable from duty to the community.
(3) The long term aim of a health education programme is to develop well-balanced personalities who have no need to resort to drugs.
Drug education should not be isolated from the whole education of the The presentation of a basis for a happy life being more effective than the presentation of penalties and miseries, though their danger must not be neglected, the immediate aim must be to provide sufficient information in the most suitable situations which will enable students to make decisions which will be neither harmful to themselves nor to the community.
the anti-authoritarian are at a special risk in respect of a range of antisocial activities, including drug abuse; a comprehensive .health
education programme would seek to identify these people and provide then with guidance, therapy and education.
(5) An effective method of education lies in discussion, both oral and written, through small groups.
The lecture, film, book and pamphlet are preliminaries or concomitants, which supply the knowledge on which discussion and conclusions are based.
(6) Teachers who are known and respected by the pupils usually have a greater influence; therefore it is essential to give present and future teachers training in handling the problem of drugs.
Authoritative statements by an accepted and respected reacher may be acceptable to pre-adolescent children; but adolescents, having reached the age of individual decision-making in many areas, will often present and reject an authoritarian approach to a social issue or a personal problem.

I therefore suggest, as tentative meeting dates, or 5 March for N.S.C.C. and 2 April for Ministers.

The Minister now writes for the Minister's agreement for a postponement of this proposed meeting until some time after March 1971, during which month a further meeting of the Standing Committee is proposed.

Assistant Secretary (Projects and Legislation Branch) National Archives of Australia MINIsTER FOR CUsTOMS AND ExCISE Commonwealth Offices, Treasury Place, My dear Minister, At our lastmeeting of Common State Ministers on Lrug Abuse in April, 190 it was decided that our next meeting should be held in Sydney in about six months.
In the ordinary course of events, I would be writing to you now to convene our next meeting.
However, in accordance with an announcement made by the Prime Minister in September, I am endear- touring to arrange a meeting of Ministers from a number of Asian countries to be held in Canberra on the 5th and 16th December.
At this t meeting, the Australian Government will be proposer ing that more formal and regular co-operation be established between countries in the Asian area in various aspects of the drug problem.
The detailed arrangements associated with such a large, international, Ministerial meeting would make it ery difficult to undertake the necessary work for an effective Commonwealthstate Ministers' meeting, at the same time.
I am informed that, at the meeting of the National StandingControl Committee held in Canberra on the 12th November, the question of the timing of a Ministerial meeting was discussed in further meeting of the Standing Committee in March,(y View that it may be more appropriate to have a with a meeting of Ministers at an early date after ' the Stending Committee meets.

The Chairman of the Standing Committee, f after consultation with members of the Committee, has proposed that themeeting of Ministers be held , in April, preceded by a meeting of the Standing ,Committee on 3 April 197O.
I now suggest that the Ministerial meeting be held on Friday 24 April and that it should be held in Canberra.

National Archives of Australia A The MInister for the Interior You will recall that the oinmonwealth and State Ministers who attended the meeting on Drug Abuse held in Melbourne on 5 May 1969 agreed that the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of dependence should recommend to Ministers when their next meeting should be held.
The National Standing Control Committee met on 9 Oetober 1969, and I am enclosing a summary record of the discussions, which has now been cleared by all parties.
You will note from agenda item 6 that the Committee agreed that it should meet again early in April 1970.
It was also agreed that Ministers be advised that there appeared to be no need for a Ministerial meeting before this next meeting of the National Standing Control Committee.
In coming to this decision, the Committee had in mind that several protects designed to improve Commonwealth; State co- ordination and co-operation in various fields were currently being developed.
It was felt that the next meeting of Ministers could more usefully be held after these protects were further advanced.
of Commonwealth and State controls over the legal trade (including the setting up of a computer service to monitor all drug transactions), the development of arrangements to consolidate the collection and dissemin- nation of drug intelligence, and the development of educnation programmes.
Another factor influencing the Committee's views was that the United Nations Commission on Narcotic rugs would meet in january l97 to produce a further draft of the proposed protocol on Psychotropic Substances.
It was felt that the Committee should have the opportunity to examine the raft Protocol and prepare recommendations for the next meeting of Ministers.
Under these circumstances, l am carrying out the wishes of the Committee and suggesting to you that the next Ministerial Mieeting be deferred until after April 1970.
The Minister for Customs and Excise has informed me that he will write to you before that time suggesting a firm date for the Ministerial Meeting.
Yours sincerely, Secretary Minister for the Interior, Parliament House, As National Archives of Australia NATIONAL STNNDINS CONTROL committee ON DBUS OF DEPENDENCE MEETING OF 9 OCTOBER 196 SUMMARY RECORD THE CHAIRMAN in opening the meeting, referred to the progress that Had been made by the Committee and the Working Parties.
On the law enforce- meant side the Working Party onDrug Intelligence had met and was moving rapidly towards completing arrangemeants for channelling drug information into the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau.
On the health side a lot had been done including excellent progress towards implementing the scheme to computerise the recording and checking of drug transactions.
AGENDA ITEM 2 FORMAL CONFIRMATION OF RECORD OF SECOND MEETING ON SNOW seconded that the minutes of the previous meeting be adopted.
AGENDA ITEM - LAW ENFORCEMENT Report of Working Party on Drug Intelligence THE CHAIRMAN explained that the Working Party had been set up under the chairmanship of Commissioner Davis who had furnished a report to the Standing Committee.
In the absence of Commissioner Davis he invited the Acting Commissioner, MR.
HARPER to speak to the Report.
HARPER summarised the recommendations of the Working Party.
He explained that a Subllorking Party under the Chairmanship of MR.
levin had damn up a form for use in reporting drug intelligence to the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau.
The form had been circulated to all parties who had agreed to use it.
The form was with the printer and when completed would be distributed.
The form was on distinctive yellow paper.
No department was shown on the top and it could be used by all parties.
In reply to a question by suede CubER, Mr, Harper explained that reminder cards mould be used to remind furnishing parties to send follow-up information.
He invited the Committee to comment on the irking Farty recomb- MR RIMES said Ne South Wales accepted the views of the Working Party.
In regard to resolution 6 the matter was before the New South ales Police Commissioner who would discuss it with Commissioner Davis.
With regard to the composite form, le agreed it was acceptable and it would ultimately appear as an official form of the New South Wales Police.
National Archives of Australia INSPECTOR SIMPSON sought clarification of the position regarding resolution 0 dealing with overdoses of Barbiturates.
WIENHOLT felt that the recommendation would need clarification before it could be considered by the Standing Committee.
''Overdose'' included matters which could not be dealt with by the C.L.I.B. MR.
levin pointed out the value of authorities having information on apparent attempted suicides.
OODRUP considered that the matter was one for the Health Working Party to consider Each event had wide possibilities of medical overtones.
They may be straight out accidents, but if intentional, then it should be reported to the authorities.
If it was a case of misadventure, it had nothing to do with law enforcement except if negligence was present.
THE CHAIRMAN supported this view but invited the attention of the Committee to the wording of the resolution - ''Is there a need for reporting?''
SNOW agreed with the need for reporting but ''overdose'' must DR be defined as either ;- Attempted suicide Suicide Accidental overdose in children Knowledge of this could give authorities an idea of the extent of misuse.
He suggested that the matter should go to the Health Working Party on the above basis.
ABBOTT said that his Departmeant opposed the reporting of such cases on the new form as most cases investigated had no law enforce- meant aspect.
In addition it would involve Police in a very large amount of work.
MR hogan considered that further discussion of this matter at this stage should be left to the Health Working Party, which could decide whether it was the type of problem appropriate for the C.C.I.B. to record.
MACINTIRE agreed it was a matter for referral to the Health Working Party.
The Mental Health services were equally involved.
MR O'DONOVAN considered that the words ''Need of reporting'' meant me reporting by Police to C.C.I.B. not Health.
The matter was therefore one for the Working Party on Drug Intelligence, to decide what Folice will do in reporting cases coming to their notice.
The other matter of what should be the obligations of the Medical Profession and Health Services to report cases should be taken up by the Health Working Party. .
DE questioned the value to Police of reports on such cases by Health Authorities unless a full report was received.
National Archives of Australia -L pointed out that a National system of reporting such cases wes already in existence.
MR levin considered it was a Police matter to see the pattern of where these cases came from.
It could be valuable for Folice to have data on conditions surrounding the various types of ''Overdose'' casease THE CHAIRMAN asked the meeting to decide :- (a) should the matter be referred to the Health Working Party?
(b) if it is to be essentially a Police matter could it go back to the Working Party on Drug Intelligence?
WIENHOLT felt that the Health Working Party would be able to come up with recommendations on what action should be taken, and moved to this effect.
AGREED TO.
The committee agreed to accept the report of the working Party.
THE CHAIRMAN formally accepted the report and congratulated the Working Party on the progress made.
AGENDA ITEM 3.2 - Review of Legislation - Progress Reports THE CHAIRMAN said that the question of review of legislation is still under review insofar as the Commonwealth was concerned.
He invited State representatives to report ondevelopments in their States.
MACINTYRE asked for clarification on the outcome of discussions on reverse onus and uniform penalty.
He felt it was important to get some recommendation.
The matter should be finalised in order to enable uniformity to be achieved.
THE chapman referred to the lengthy discussions that the meeting of Ministers had on reverse onus.
Before the Commonwealth moved there would be discussions with the States.
He pointed out that there had been specific recommendations to Ministers from the Working Party on Legislation.
NWOODRUFE reported that a submission had gone to the Government of S.A. to amend legislation to incorporate the recommendations.
It was anticipated the bill would be dealt with in the current session of Parliament.
MR STRUTTON said that Queensland was looking into possible amend- mens of the health Act.
Consideration was also being given to a separate act for drugs of dependence and drug penalties.
SNOW advised that the matter was still under consideration in Nafional Archives of Australia MR. RIMES said that in New South Wiales any amendments would be in respect of penalties for pedlars and similar offences.
levin said that Victorian law at present adequately covered DR.
MACINTYRE said that the recommendations were under consid- aeration by the Tasmanian authorities.
STRUTTON pointed out the possibility that States could bring in increased penalties but come up with differing scales.
THE CHAIRMAN appreciated that this could happen but he envisaged that all States would ultimately progress towards a desirable level of penalties.
He believed that the Ministers had accepted in principle the need for increased and uniform penalties.
Problems in Co-operation and Liaison THE CHAIRMAN explained that the item had its origin in directives from Ministers that the committee develop co-operation and liaison to a maximum degree.
This included development of the C.C .I.B.
He took the opportunity to report developments in the Customs Narcotics Bureaue Shortly after the Ministers meeting he was based to go overseas to visit Scotland Yard and the US, Narcotics Bureau.
The latter organs- nation was most anxious to co-operate with the Customs Bureau.
In addition an operative of the U.S. Bureau stationed in Thailand would be coming to Australia in the near future for discussions with Customs and Police.
The coming to Australia in February, 1970.
Customs had taken up an invitation to send two persons to the Federal Narcotics Bureau School.
The two officers had successfully completed the course and were ncw engaged in field operations with the U.S, Narcotics Bureau.
The officer recently recruited from the Victorian Police had gained first place in the Course.
Mr. Carmody said that, subject tothe approval of Commissioners, arrangements would be made for selected Police Officers to attend future courses.
A senior Chemist from the Customs Laboratory had also visited scient tific establishments in U.SA and Canada and this matter would be dealt with under Agenda Item 3.5.
He considered that the exchange of officers between Customs and the Victoria Police was highly successful but he now felt that such a formal arrangement was no longer necessary, particularly in view of the successful working together of Customs/Police teams in joint operations in most States.
Problems of conflicting interest had been virtually eliminated.
Customs Narcotics Bureau Officers had been directed to pass on to Police any cases involving users and petty pedlars.
He felt that a lot of progress had been made in the area of co-operation.
He then said that he had received approval tostrengthen the Narcotics Bureau and gave an outline of the proposals.
Nalional Archives of Australia MR levin agreed that the exchange of officers in Victoria had worked very well and to the advantage of both parties.
He appreciated the opportunity given for State Police officers to go overseas to attend courses in drug investigation.
MR RIMES said that New South ales was very happy with the degree of co-operation between Police and Customs.
He would be pleased to receive information on the proposed courses.
INSPECTOR SIMPSON reported that there had been two Police/Customs field operations in Queensland.
They were a prime example of good co- operation.
He felt that his Commissioner would welcome the offer of very good and his Department was happy with the assistance given.
He supported the idea of overseas courses.
INSPECTOR burros stated that his Department enjoyed the utmost co-operation from Customs and was very happy with the present position.
DR. MACINTYRE advised that the Commissioner of Police would be interested in the Chairman's offer of courses for police officers in U.S.A. and said that he had held discussions with the Folice Commissions who was very happy with the degree of co-operation which existed in Tasmania.
SNOW suggested that it would be useful to prepare a brief statement proposed overseas study courses to justify to Ministers the need for these trips.
THE CHAIRMAN agreed.
AGENDA ITEM 3,4 Reports of illicit transactions and seizures to U.N. and Interpol THE CHAIRMAN explained that the item related to the fact that under the SINGLE CONVENTION Australia had the responsibility to forward information to the Narcotics Commission.
Customs was responsible for this reporting and had been receiving the required information direct from the States - particularly from New South Wales.
A situation had now arisen where, because of decisions arising from the Working Party on Drug Intelligence, there was a possibility of unnecessary duplication of work arising.
This should be eliminated.
The matter concerned the furnishing of reports on illicit drug transactions.
He believed the simplest way to avoid duplication would be that, when these forms are sent to the C.t.1., a photo copy would be sent to Customs for processing and subsequent report to the U.N.
He emphasised that copies would be procured of only those forms which contained information which Australia was required to furnish to the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs.
woodruff wondered if such an arrangement might influence what police would put into the report.
National Archives of Australia HARPER said that C.C.I.B. would not pass on any information which the States did not want passed ona INSPECTOR SIMPSON said that Queensland envisaged the form of report being furnished to C,u.1.., which would extract information from the form for supply to Customs.
ironer that, since Customs is a full contributor to the C...B. it is entitled to get all the information it required on drug intelligence from the Bureau.
MR levin said that this was the Victoriaview also MR.
O'DONDVAN stressed that the Commonwealth Folice were neutral in the matter and would abide by the Committee's decision.
However, they would not like to see a precedent created whereby intelligence information was disseminated to noncontributing parties.
MR RIMES felt that there should not be anything to inhibit the exchange of information between contributing parties.
If it was confidential to a particular Police force, it could be marked so.
MRe NEtIN agreed that there should be mobarriers to full exchange of information.
HARPER said that if the reports or parts thereof were marked ''restricted'' the restricted information would not be passed on to another body without the approval of the originating authority.
caller suggested that only those authorities who contributed information should be entitled to obtain intelligence material from the C.C.I.B.
From the operational aspect Police could have suspicions about persons and these could be included on the form if Police were sure that the form had limited circulation.
The Committee agreed to the following :- ''On the understanding that the Department of and Excise will provide Ill aPd comprehensive dr the have no obvention to that AGENDA ITEM 3. Establishment bv THE CHAIRMAN said that reestablishment of the laboratory had its origin in a visit to the US.
Narcotics Bureau by a Senior Customs Chemist.
The Bureau had also asked Australia to co-operate with it in research programmes.
A particular project was analysis of the constituents of National Archives of Australia marihuana.
The Narcotics laboratory would be equipped to carry out forensic research into drugs of dependence with the prime object of assisting all law enforcement bodies.
All members of the Committee expressed support for the stab- lishment of the Laboratory.
AGENDA ITEM 4 REPORT OF HEALTH WORKING PARTY ted e Sontrol over licit traffic THE CHAIRMAN invited DR.
WEINHOLT to speak to the item.
WIENHOIT summarised the recommendations of the Health Working Party and invited State representatives to express their views on the question MR.
MOAN agreed with the proposals.
TMES asked if States were obligated to accept full inspects THE CHAIRMAN assured MR PTMES that Customs would liaise with each state with the obtect of ensuring a smooth transition period which would vary according to the circumstances in each State.
PATRICK advised that Queensland also had some initial problems and would like to discuss details with Customs at the officer levels DR.
WOODRUFF expressed agreement with the proposals and advised that he had obtained approval for an additional Inspector.
MACINTIRE said he was pleased with the progress made in closing possible loopholes.
However, as next step it may be wise to concentrate interstate movements of amphetamines. .
SNOW advised that WA, was prepared to accept inspectorial functions but would probably need assistance during the first three months of 970.
He asked that the following corrections be made to the report of the Health Working Party :- Paragraph 3.1.4 .
''W.A intended licensing people dealing in stimulants'' -. this was incorrect as the State already licensed such people.
W.A, did not agree that transactions in barbiturates and tranqualizers may need to be monitored in the future.
THE CHAIRMAN advised that the report would be amended accordingly.
DR WIENHOIT sa virtue in Customs and state Health continuing to work together until late in 197.
National Archives of Australia THE CHAIRMAN commended the Health Working Party and the Commonwealth Dept, of Health as well as the Sub-Wiorking Party on Monitoring for the work that they had carried out.
AGENDA ITEM 4,2 - Health Education DR.
WIENHOLT invited State representatives to report on action taken by them in the Health Education field.
He reported that on the in Health Education in Relation to Drug Abuse.
Dr Wells was undertaking to see that people attend ding the course were offered every facility; (2) Preparations for the production of an educational film on drug dependence were well advanced.
The Working Party handling planning for the firm had been asked to proceed with arrangements forpoduction.
MES presented to themeeting a roneod document setting out action taken by N.S W. in the Health Education area.
R Olo reported that the Health Education Council had intend sifted its activities and the National Fitness Council had also been brought into the campaign.
used the N.S.W, teaching kit.
The Education Department had been approached to assist in Health Education in High Schools.
Appropriate officers would be sent to the Sydney Seminar.
M roan reported that the Health Department would be sending four officers to the seminar on health education DR.
WIENHOLT asked States which had not furnished a written report on action taken to do so as soon as possible.
PATRICK said that the Health Education Council in Queensland which had been operating in the field for many years had recently stepped up its activities in this area.
DR WOODRUFF said that Police officers dealing with drug matters were often asked questions with llealth connotations.
lle asked if suitable courses on Hlealth Education could be held for Folice Officers.
DR WINHOIT said he would look at tlematter and see what was being done overseas.
If anything worthwhile could be done he would look at it from the point of view of a residential seminar.
- : sinter indicated that Tasmania would wish to apply for admission to the Health Education Seminar, PR.
MIENHOLI in reply to queries regarding attendance by Police Officers and persons from voluntary agencies, proposed that the matter be left on the basis that States choose their own representatives.
National Archives of Australia THE CHAIRMAN referred to the commercial film ''TEasy Riders'', and tad that it had been shown by the Chief Film Censor to Dr. Clements, ing whether it undermined efforts in education against drug abuse.
Cn the advice of these persons the Film Censorship Board decided to reject the film,
The Chairman referred to Educational handout material which he had received from the U.S Bureau of Narcotics and offered to obtain copies for distribution to States through the Commonwealth Health Department.
AOENDA ITEM W.3 Mental Health Aspects THE CHAIRMAN asked DR.
MIENHOUT to talk to the item and suggested that the matter of terminology i.e. drug dependence'' as against drug addiction'' be taken up.
under article 18 of the Single Convention, to furnish statistics of drug dependence to U.N.
It was clear that such statistics had to be improved.
He advised that the N.H. d M.R.C. had agreed to a definition of drug dependence which was set out in the ''Gloasary of Mental Disorders'' published by the Council.
'OAN accepted this definition provided that it was for statistical purposes only, as it could not be applied generally in Wiotoria, as the Victorian Act had a different definition of drug dependent PRe MElS pointed out that, whilst States had different definitions, all had agreed to international classifications of mental disorders and this included the definition of dependence.
THE CHAIRMAN considered that there was need for commonality of definition for the purpose of reporting atatistios of dependence to U.N. DR.
WIENHOUE pointed out that if there was a different set of figures for mental health statistics on dependence and data sent to Customs the disorepanoies could well be picked up.
Also any information that Australia supplied to U.N. must be complementary to information supplied by other countries.
The statistical eriterim were a matter for consultation OGAN pointed out that in victoria it was necessary to adhere to the definition of addition laid down by law.
There was a different abasia for mentalhealth statistics of dependence and statistics sent to Customs for the Annual Report.
MRe RIME greed that the Committee adopt the definition of dependence laid down in the glossary of Mental Disorders'' prepared by the N.H.
He slad that he would like any ouch decision to be formally recorded because it would drastically change statistics received from the DEM SOT.
ABBOTT suggested that data concerning users of drugs not established as addicts be furnishedunder the heading of drug abuse.
National Archives of Australia DOCTORS BNOW R PATRICK agreed that whilst it was acceptable to use the term 'dependence'', it was necessary to be clear as to the meaning of the The Committee agreed that statistics 9f 9 Australia's Annual report would be compiled on the basis of the definition of dependence contained in the Glossary of Mental Disorders'' produced by the N.H. 8 M.R.E.
AGENDA ITEM 1,3 () Treatment and Social Rehabilitation of Addicts DR.
MIENHOLI said that the Health Working Party acknowledged this to be a State responsibility.
It was incorrect therefore for the Common- wealth to indicate what it believed States should do in their own areas.
MR RIMES considered that the question nevertheless should not be pushed aside.
lt was an important item for the Committee and it should mr be left open for future discussion.
roan felt that this subject was not an appropriate one for discussion by the Committee.
The proposal, if adopted, instructed how States were to deal with the treatment of drug dependent persons and this was, he said, a matter for the States.
He thought that the first concept of the proposal was not appropriate for the Committee, as the matter was exclusively one for restates to provide thetreatment facilities they want.
THE CHAIRMAN said that the Commonwealth was not prepared, without further consideration by the Commonwealth Minister's concerned, to undertake financial responsibility for treatment.
However this should not inhibit discussion by the Standing Committee.
MR RIMES pointed out that the Committee had been discussing common areas of concern and he felt that treatment was also a common area and should be discussed.
endations on treatment at its March meeting and it was now a matter for the States to consider them.
WIENHOUI suggested that the Committee ask the Health iiorking Party to examine the problem of treatment and rehabilitation.
roan said that he had no charter nor could he pledge any support for it.
THE CHAIRMAN verified that the subject was within the Committee's terms of reference as laid down by Ministers.
MOODRUFE agreed to the matter being referred to the Health Working Party. the nd rehab question of treatment a be referred to the health Working Partv for its vlewss Nnational Archives of Australia THE CHAIRMAN explained the present position with regard to preparer nation of the draft Frotocol and announced that he intended to recommend that representnation at the Plenipotentiary Conference be drawn from the Standing Committee.
He explained that the January meeting of the Narcotics Commission would merely put together a further draft Frotocol on the basis of comments received from governments.
Australia would have ample time to examine this next draft which would be examined in detail and amended as required at the Plenipotentiary conference.
predominantly health flavour the delegation should be comprised mainly of Health representatives.
AGENDA ITEM 6 MEETING OF MINISTERS IAIRMAN explained that the Meeting of Ministers on 9 Mayhad THE CI left it to the standing Committee to recommend when the next meeting of Ministers should be held, He felt in the light of the current work of the Standing Committee, it was not appropriate for Ministers to meet at present.
He also invited the Committee to consider when the Standing Committee might meet again.
The Committee agreed that it should meet regain earl in advised bY the Chairman that there appeared to be ng need the for a Ministerial meetng before the next meet National Standing Control Committee to be held in April.
AGENDA ITEM 7 - ADVICE TO INDUSTRY OF PERSCNS DEEMED TO BE ''SECURITY RISKS MR.
RIMES said that NS.W. did not want to set up any formal line of communication or provide a central reporting service in a matter of this THE CHAIRMAN agreed and added that the Commonwealth could not provide such a service.
RoAN pointed out that even an informal arrangement of reporting without indemnity could lead to trouble.
be considered that the problem could be covered by the fact that people engaged in drug operations had to be approved under State law.
levin pointed out that the initiative was coming from the trade to approach the authorities in regard to theproblem of security risks. .
SNOW asked whether there was in fact any information regarding persons such as addicts or persons dismissed for theft.
ELLS explained that the lanaging-irector of a firm had approached Health.
One firm had sacked 8 persons following loesses of drugs.
Subsequently it was found that five of the former employees had been engaged by other drug firms.
The Managing-Director had then raised the matter with the health Department.
National Archives of Austalia INSFPECTOP SIMPSON said that he had ascertained that in queensland there were many instances where persons were dismissed without charges being laid and police had no record of their activities.
However, he had found that employers normally checked with previous employers concerning the suitability of applicants.
MR roan said that informal arrangements were made within the DR SNOW considered that when the new monitoring procedures were operating, lt might be easier for employers to get evidence to prosecute dishonest employees.
Re MIENHOII pointed out that the Government was seeking the co-operation of Industry in establishing the system for the monitoring of licit transactions in drugs of dependence.
Now industry had approached Health authorities for assistance and we should not say that nothing could be done.
He suggested that the Committee announce that the States are developing informal arrangements and that industry will be able to approach the appropriate authority for assistance The Committee agreed that industry be informed thr formal basis for such advice could be set un but that extension of informal avenues of liaison would be THE CHAIRMAN explained that the importation of Amphetamines was controlled for the purpose of restricting them to legitimate channels.
imported had been very large and inquiries concerning requirements for 1970 showed that even greater quantities were being sought.
It was considered that some importers might be stocking up because of possible restrictions being applied later.
M hogan suggested that the matter be considered by the Public Health Advisory Committee of the N.H.
MIENHOUT agreed and added that the Publie Health Advisory Committee should look at the question of amphetamines and the way they are being used.
THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that the problem of stocking up was already with us and it was necessary to make a decision on the level of 197O importations as soon as possible.
He asked whether it would be possible for the Sub Committee of N.H. % M R.C. to deal with the matter in time.
DR woodruff felt that there would be general support for not allowing greater imports in 197oO than in 1969.
THE CHAIRMAN suggested that Customs ascertain what stocks importers have and what their usage had been and then confine 1970 imports to recouping quantities used.
Nafional Archives of Australia MR. IMES pointed out that there were very few medical cases requiring the use of amphetamines.
N.S.W, had recommended Schedule 8 control and limitation of use to narcolepsy and brain-damaged children.

The Committee agreed that the question of medical use of amphetamines be referred to the NH. 8 MiEC.
tt a resort and that in the meantime the Department o toms and Excise should impose import quotas for 1097O based on the level of consumption of amphetamines SUPT.
caller asked the Committee for clarification on which authorities would be entitled to extract information from the C.C.I.B.
He pointed out that the armed services and A.S.I.0.
were examples of other authorities which might seek information.
However, once extended, there was no knowing where it would lead to.
The Committee should ensure that people seeking information should do so through the contributing authorities from the States concerned.
M rims suggested that requests be looked at on the basis of need and dealt with at the discretion of C.v..1.. MR.
O'DCNOVAN said that C.C.I.B. would not accept the proposition that there be a limit placed on the types of authorities entitled to information.
However he agreed that requests by noncontributing parties should go through the police in the State concerned.,
ABBOTT stated that the N.S.W. Commissioner of Police wanted it known that he would supply information only to other Police authorities and to Customs without his Department first being consulted.
THE CHAIRMAN considered that the matter was one for negotiation between C.w.1.. and State Police at Commissioner level.
The Committee reed which contributed informatin the led to obtain informati n from that body as a matter is was a matter for THE CHAIRMAN in closing the meeting thanked delegates for their active participation and expressed great satisfaction with the way the Committee had developed.
What had greatly impressed him was that when it first met members of the Committee had some reservations but it was now National Archives of Australia clear that they were able to get together and were making progress.
The problem of drug dependence was getting worse and would get a lot worse before it improved.
His trip overseas had snowed him that the situation in U.S.A. was shocking and not much better in U.K. and Europe.
The problem was not as bad in Australia and every effort had to be made to stop it becoming so.
re IMEs in reply agreed that the Committee now worked as a team.
He said that provided members could subjugate feelings for their own organisations the Committee could continue to work together effectively.

Attashed for your information is a weepy of the reply National Archives of Australia NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE ON DRUGS OF DEPENDENCE Minister for the Interior, Parliament House, I am attaching hereto the report of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence, as requested by Ministers for their meeting on the Bth May.
The Committee has met formally on two occasions and to assist its deliberations, it set up working parties to consider particular subjects.
Ministers will appreciate that, because of the relatively short time since their earlier meeting, it has not been possible for the Standing Committee to go in depth into all aspects of the matters set out in its terms of reference.
However, positive suggestions have been made to increase n the Health area, Ministers will note that a preliminary examination has been made of the wide range of future activities.
Indeed, the recommendations of the Standing Committee in this area might be regarded as a blueprint for farther action.
I particularly invite the attention of Ministers to the recommendations of the Standing Committee as to its future activities and meetings.
Yours sincerely, for National Archives of Australia A It,'w a xs A NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE a ON DRUGS OF DEPENDENCE REPORT TO MINISTERS NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE ON JGS OF DEPENDENCE REPORT TO MINISTERS This report has been prepared as directed by Ministers at the Commonwealths State Ministers' Meeting on Drugs of Dependence held A The National Standing Control Committee consists of representatives of the Commonwealth Ddepartments of Customs and Excise, Attorney- General's, Health and Interior and the departments in each State concerned with the problems of drug abuse.
The Comptroller-General of Customs is the Chairman.
The Committee was directed to: (a) consider immediately the further steps that can be taken by the Commonwealth and rotates together to combat all aspects of the present drug problem in Australia including addiction, trafficking, treatment and education; and (b) to make recommendations to Ministers on legislation and administrative action which should be taken.
Meetings of the Committee were held on 7 March and 1l April 1969.
The summary records of these meetings are attached.
The Committee felt that its designated task could best be fulfilled by a consideration of the overall problem under two broad LAW ENFORCEMENT 1. Problems in co -operation and liaison Current legislation in the field of controlling the illicit traffic in drugs is enforced at Commonwealth level by the department of Customs and Excise and at State level by Police Drug Squads.
Because investigations often overlap and because drug abuse is a national problem, the Committee felt that positive steps must be taken to improve the present arrangements for co-ordination and co-operation between all law enforcement authorities.
As a first step towards achieving this obiective, the Comptrollers General of Customs proposed an exchange of officers in each State, between the Customs Narcotics Bureau and Police Drug Squads.
The Commonwealth felt that if this proposal were implemented, the problem of overlapping investigations would disappear and further, that it would provide another means of exchanging intelligence information at operational level.
State reactions to the proposal are set out in Agenda Item 2.l on page 2 of the summary record of the meeting of 11 April 1969.
It will be seen that with the exception of New South Walesg and queensland, all State representatives agreed with the proposal in principle but that because the problem in W.A., S.A and tasmania is not as great as in the other three States, it'is not necessary to implement such arrangements in these States at the present time.
2. Exchange of Information The Committee considered that there is a need for a central source to collect and disseminate intelligence information on illicit activities within Australia.
Such a source must have the capacity to collate.
evaluate and disseminate data from all enforcement agencies (and possibly health authorities) on offenders and suspects, suppliers, convicted addicts, etc, to enable a co-ordinated attack on the illicit drug traffic.
The Committee noted that the following organisations were in existence at the present time: a (i) A Central Crime Intelligence Bureau within the Commonwealth Ppolice which required information on narcotics offences as part of its overall task of a assessing organised crime in Australia; (ii) A narcotic intelligence unit situated within the A Customs Narcotics Bureau which at present a collected and disseminated narcotics intelligence from within Australia and overseas for its own operational purposes; and (iii) A Central Drug Bureau operated by the New South Wales Ppolice Foree in conjunction with police forces in other States.
The Committee noted that certain recent proposals by the Conference of Police Commissioners had attempted to define the relative roles of the Commonwealth Central Crime Intelligence Bureau and the N.S.W. Central Drug Bureau.
The Committee resolved: 'That the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau established and maintained by Commonwealth Police should be extended to include information in regard to drug intelligence and that a Working Party comprised of Commonwealth and State officials affected, be established to examine how it should 3. Communication with International Bodies As The Committee noted that the Department of Customs and Excise maintained comprehensive links with overseas drug agencies and that the ietorian Police Commissioner is the Interpol contact in Australia.
The question of State representation at overseas conferences was discussed and the Committee felt that if effective co-operation and co-ordination were achieved, State representatives should attend such 4. Review of Legislation The Committee appointed a Working Party under the Chairmanship of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's department to review possible deficiencies in enforcement and penalty provisions in existing legislation relating to drug control.
The Working Party examined recent case law in England redefining the concept of possession'' and considered deficiencies in Customs and State legislation.
I broad terms, the Committee agreed that reverse onus of proof should be applied to drug offences.
The specific recommendations of this Working Party are set out in Attachment 'A' of the summary record of the meeting of l1l April 1969.
The Committee has adopted these recommendations.
However, the report was not received by the Standing Committee until after the com mencement of their meeting on ll April and, for this reason, could not be thoroughly examined.
Subsequently, the Commonwealth representatives, because of the demonstrated need to improve the legal evidentiary prod visions of the Customs Acet to overcome difficulties in proving Common- wealth offences, decided to make the following additional recommendation to Ministers.
This recommendation has not yet been considered by the Standing Committee.
) that the Customs Act should be amended to incorporate the reverse onus as to the fact of importation of prescribed drugs which are ordinarily imported.
HEALTH ASPECTS A Working Party under the Chairmanship of the Commonwealth department of Health was appointed to consider: (a) licit transactions involving Single Convention drugs and other drugs of dependence; A The convenor of the Working Party called together the relevant committees of the NH and MRC in anticipation of the first meeting of the Working Party.
A report of the Working Party was prepared and is annexed as Attachment B of the summary record of the meeting of 1l April 1969.
The Committee's views on the Working Party Report are set I out hereunder: 2. Health Education The Committee adopted the recommendations of the Working Party except that in relation to item 2.11 of the Report.
The representatives of the Ddepartment of Customs and Excise and the Commonwealth Attorney-General's department felt that although this I recommendation might be an accurate assessment of the principles involved, in view of the immediate need to combat unfavourable publicity, the recommendation is not sufficiently constructive.
They felt that Ministers should consider the issue of an authoritative white paper on the problems associated with narcotics and drugs of dependence or at least to decide some positive steps that should be taken.
Some State Representatives also supported the issue of a white paper.
8. Mental Health Aspects The Committee adopted the recommendations of the Working Party except: 3.4.
Treatment and Social Rehabilitation of Addicts The Committee deleted all words after discouraged'' in the second 4. Controls over Licit Traffic The Committee felt that there was scope for closer co-operation between Commonwealth and States in controlling the legal distribution of narcotics and other drugs of dependence.
The Comptroller-General of Customs informed the Committee that it was the view of the Commonwealth that such matters were primarily the concern of Health departments and that areas of overlapping control by Commonwealth and States could be virtually eliminated.
The Department of Customs and Excise considered that it was preferable to have a single authority co- urinating the licit distribution of narcotics and therefore offered to hand over this role to the Commonwealth Department of Health.
The Depart- meant of Customs and Excise would have to retain its responsibility for Imports/ Export controls and its statutory responsibility under the Narcotic Drugs Act.
Further, the Commonwealth offered to vacate the inspection activities involved in controlling drug distribution in favour of State Health Departments provided it received regular stock figures in respect of wholesalers.
md The Committee noted that State Ministers had stressed the need for a central clearing house to collect and disseminate information relating to interstate movements of prescribed drugs.
The Committee resolved that paragraph l of the Working Party'g recommendation be amended as follows: (i) That a system be set up to collect, collate and A disseminate information on all interstate move- mens of drugs of dependence and that a Working Party be established to introduce such a system The Working Party should, at the same time examine the feasibility, value and practicability of establishing a system to provide information on all aspects of the intrastate trade.
After a close examination of its future activities, the Committee recommends that there is no need for permanent subcommittees and that its operations can best be facilitated by ad hoc Working Parties as required.
This report has indicated the areas in which the Committee propose to continue its activities and recommends to Ministers that the Standing Control Committee should meet at least every 6 months and more often if circumstances require.
NATIONAL standi CONTROL COMMITTEE MEETING OF 11 APRIL 1969 SUMMARY RECORD A AGENDA ITEM 1. SUMMARY RECORD OF FIRST MEETING The summary record of the meeting held on 7th March 1969 was adopted.
The Committee agreed to amend the wording of its resolution in regard to the terms of reference of the Health Working Party.
Because it was clearly intended that the Working Party examine the whole field of licit distribution, sub paragraph (a) of the resolution was amended to read: '(a) licit transactions involving Single Convention drugs and other drugs of dependence.''
AGENDA ITEM 2. LAW ENFORCEMENT 2.1 Problems in Co-operation and Liaison The Chairman referred to the recommendation of the previous meeting that each State examine the Customs proposal for the exchange of Customs Narecotic Officers and State Police Drug quad officers and report back to the present meeting.
He called upon the State representatives to record their reaction to the proposal.
Victoria supported the proposal but all other States indicated, that, in line with the recommendation of the recent Police Commissioner's Conference, the proposal was not supported.
The Chairman said that he was amazed at the negative reaction to the proposal, particularly when the Ministers had directed the Committee to take further steps to improve co-ordination and co-operation and to make specific recommendations in that regard.
Ministers wanted the Committee to demonstrate publicly that it was determined to come up with constructive In the circumstances, it seemed that he would be forced to report to Ministers that the Committee did not agree that any improvement was necessary.
He agreed that South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania may not need a formal exchange at present but that did not apply in the States with the greatest problem.
a Mr, Dillon proposed that the reactions of each State to the proposal be recurse mn the summary record.
He urged that the Committee affirm that it realized the need for greater co-operation and co-ordination and moved the following resolution: ''That this meeting confirm that positive steps must be taken to improve the present arrangements for co- ordination and co-operation between all law enforcement a Pr.
nOw seconded the motion which was carried unanimously.
After discussion, State Representatives recorded their reactions as follows: Mr. Rimes (N. S. W.) endorsed the resolution of the recent Conference of police commissioners, which did not support the exchange of officers between Customs and State Ppolice authorities.
However he undertook to bring the views of other States and the Commonwealth to the notice of his Government with a view to his Minister being in a position to state definitely the views of the New South Wales Government on the Commonwealth Victoria agreed with the exchange proposal.
Victoria was prepared to accept the Commonwealth's offer on a trial basis, the extent and duration of attachment to be determined by negotiation.
Mr. Strutton (O.) said that the offer of the Commonwealth referred o a Iaw enforcement matter and as such, the final decision would be made by the Minister in charge of the Police Department in Queensland A who is the Premier.
It had not been possible for his Minister to discuss the matter with the Premier and the opinions which would be given at this meeting would be decisions of officers which could rightly be vetoed by their respective Ministers.
He asked that it be lack or desire of co-operation with the Customs Department.
On this particular point he asked that Mr. Simpson speak on the proposal.
Inspector Simrson (.) said that his Commissioner did not propose to exchange personnel of the Police Drug Squad with officers of the Narcotise Bureau, and this is in accordance with the resolution of the recent Commissioners Conference.
However, every co-operation and co-ordination has already been given and with a view of improving these matters, monthly meetings are being held.
In pursuance of this policy, a meeting was held on 26th March, 1969 when a format for improved liaison was established and is now in operation.
buperintenent alder (S.A.) considered that exchange of Police and narcotics Officers was not a workable proposition at the moment, particularly in view of present good co-operation and the small drug problem in this State.
However, the offer was not rejected.
It should be left open so that his State could participate should further conditions make an exchange possible and worthwhile.
operation at present and felt that, whilst supporting the proposal in principle, there was no need for an exchange of officers at present.
consldered that it would be impracticable at present to exchange officers formally, but greater co-ordination of activity was necessary.
Exchange of Information The Chairman drew attention to the proposal on the establishment of a National rug Intelligence Bureau put forward by Mr. millon at the previous meeting and deferred to the current meeting so as to enable it to be considered by State authorities.
He asked State representatives to give their views on the proposal.
Mr. Rimes stated that the Conference of Police Commissioners had operational information on drugs for all Police forces.
The Commonwealth Central Crime intelligence Bureau would not be operational but would be concerned with statistical recording.
He confirmed this Mr Dillon understood that the consensus of opinion of Commissioners was that each Police Force should have its own information service.
He envisaged a National Drug Intelligence Bureau within the Commonwealth Central Crime Intelligence Bureau into which would be fed all information, including information from the New South Wales operational bureau, and to which States could go direct for information.
The Chairman pointed out that the Commonwealth had also considered the matter and had taken note of the existence of the Intelligence Section within the Customs Narcotics Bureau and the need for drug information to be collected and analysed by the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau as part of its examination of organised crime in Australia.
It wmould be necessary to ascertain what intelligence information customs mould obtain from the N S W. Bureau and from the suggested Central Crime Intelligence urea.
operational intelligence on drugs whilst the Central Intelligence Bureal dealt with crime generally.
Ignector Simnson asked where the National Drug Intelligence Burea oecaten and whether it would be necessary for State Police A to send information both to it and to the N, SW Burea.
The Chairman explained that Police Commissioners had decided that tional Drug Bureaux should be located both with the N.S.
W. Police nd Commonwealth Police.
He added that the Department of Customs nd Exeise as the Australian control body for purposes of the single Convention receives from State Police for transmission to the United Nations reports of all seizures of Narcotics in Australia.
Details of these reports, together with all Customs Intelligence reports are collated and can be made available to operational law enforcement bodies at present.
In addition to this he said that apparently Police Commissioners shed to have set up a record of all drug prosecutions within the Commonwealth Police and a Central Operational Record System with te NS, W, Police.
He could not see the logie in such proliferation Mr RImes suggested that a Working Party be set up to work ou entails concerning the furnishing of information to the authoritles mr lion moved the following recommendation in substitution ior MThat the Central Crime Iintelligence Bureau established and maintained by Commonwealth Police should be intended to include information in regard to drug intelligence and that a Working Party, comprised ol Comnmonwealth and State officials affected, be established to examine how it should operate.
w seconded the motion which was agreed io.
Reoort of Workin Partv on Review of Legislation Tke Chairman in introducing the report, said that the purpose of the forging Party's deliberations was to be able to report to Ministers 0n efficiencies in legislation.
He was surprised that so few had been referred to in this report.
, Dilon suggested that the report bhe summarized in the form o The Chairman asked if there was any objection to the Committee acormmending to Ministers that the reverse onus device is approprlae to drug offences and should be incorporated in legislatlon Mr Rimes proposed the following resolution: nTho Committee resolved that the report of the irking Party be endorsed but that it be redrafted 1 the form of recommendations to be issued t embers of the National Standing Committee IOr The morton was carried.
The report of the Working arty is Attachment ''A a In discussing penalties some representatives expressed the view that because of operational difficulties, it was preferable for most offences to be dealt with summarily.
AGENDA item a. REPORT OF HEALTH wiring PARTY 3.1 Health Education Dr. Wienholt on the invitation of the Chairman, introduced the report generally he explained that, because of all the varying forces involved and the concern of Education Departments about extra-curricular activities, implementation of the recommendations would take time and not a great deal could be achieved before the Meeting of Ministers on The Committee agreed to the following recommendations proposed by the Working Party: 8.1.1
School Children The elements of an education programme about the usage and occasional abuse of drugs should be set into the general obiectives of a health education programme commencing before the child enters the phase of experimentation.
This would include - (i) Teaching in schools and provision of approprlate text, resource materials and aids to instruction including films and (ii) Teacher education in the pharmacological, physiological, psychological and social aspects of drug abuse and in discriminating consumer usage of drugs as part of the and provision of teacher handbooks.
(iii) An advisory service to teachers where drug abuse is suspected.
Doctors and Dentists 'The attention of the appropriate education authorities should be drawn to the need for the teaching of social aspects associated with the use and abuse of drugs and particularly drugs of dependence or addiction, both at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels'' ''The attention of the Pharmaceutical Association of Australia and State Pharmaceutical Societies be drawn to The responsible role which pharmacists play in the community in relation to the distribution of drugs of dependence, education of the public and adequate security with respect to these drugs.''
3. 1. 4 Women of middle age who are at risk in relation to drugs 'The attention of the National Council of Women and other appropriate organisations should be drawn to the problems which are common among women.
These can often lead to undue usage of drugs of dependence especially barbiturates.
There is a need for positive action to be taken by the National Council of Women and other appropriate organisations a to assist as many as possible of these women at risk '' 3. 1.5 Training of key health education personnel ''Consideration should be given to the organisation of a A residential training course of approximately two weeks duration for training key health education personnel from each of the States in the most effective educational methods with respect of drugs.''
The Chairman asked the Committee to look carefully at the matter of publicity campaigns because there were two schools of thought on the matter.
Dr Wienholt said that the Working Party had borne this in mind ut ret that whenever there had been campaigns designed to counter publicity the resultant publicity had the opposite effect.
The Chairman considered that the recommendation was negative although not objectionable as far as principles are concerned.
The fears of the Working Party that publicity may cause drug taking to become fashionable had been realized years ago.
What was needed was judicious publicity to try to counteract antisocial publicity.
It was not good enough to run away from the challenge.
If the problem was ignored, it would not just go away.
He felt that Governments should consider issuing something akin to a white paper counteracting Mr. Edmunds agreed that authorities could not feel confident that the rue bracts were available to the people if no effort was made to inform them of these facts.
He instanced publicity about the recommendations of the U. K Inter departmental Committee on Cannabis.
He asked by what medium do authorities answer the ''legalie pot'' campaign.
Mr Regan moved that the following recommendation of the Working arty be adopted: ''(1) No co-ordinated press campaign should be conducted to counteract - (i) sensationalism in the press, (iii) the permissive approach of the so- called (a) There is no means of knowing how the information presented would be used or (b) If the emphasis is too strongly towards prohibition then this may produce the undesirable effect of leading to its rejection and the adoption of the very activity which it is intended to extinguish.
(e) Excessive publicity may be generated and some people may see the indulgence in drugs as constituting fashionable behaviour'.
''(2) mass media may be useful for - (i) the dissemination of factual material about specific activities which are being undertaken in relation to (ii) the provision of positive information about prevalence rates, educational needs, sources of consultation and facilities available to the community, etc.
It was felt that there may be considerable advantage in authorities handling educational activities in relation to drugs having frank discussions with A representatives of the mass media when specific Mr Dillon seconded the motion which was carried on the votes of the fates and Commonwealth Health Department.
ine chairman pointed out that two thirds of the Commonwealth represent datives did not support the motion in its present form.
The following words would be inserted in the report to Ministers.
'Representatives of the departments of Customs and Exeise and Attorney-General's felt that, although these recommendations might be an accurate assessment of the principles involved.
in view of the immediate need to combat unfavourable publicity the recommendation is not sufficiently constructive.
They felt that Ministers should consider the issue of an authoritative white paper on the problem associated with narcotics and drugs of dependence, or at least to decide some positive steps that should be taken''.
Some State Representatives also supported the issue of a white paper.
The Committee adopted the following recommendation of the Working Party: The following groups in the community should have priority with regard to education about drugs of dependence: (i) Teachers, leaders of youth groups and other similar vironment and of detecting at an early stage the potential drug dependent.
(iii) Medical profession, particularly with respect to their responsibility in prescribing drugs of dependence'', 3.2.
Mental Health Aspects 3.2.1.
Information on Addicts Dr. Wienholt in introducing the recommendation of the Health Working arty relaung to the collection of information about drug dependents., explained that the present system using the Bureau of Census and Statistics to collect and collate information was a basic system which would be expanded as required after discussions between the States and the Bureau.
The meeting agreed that the following recommendation be made to ''A programme is necessary to collect information about and allied psycho-stimulants, barbiturates, and also drugs with similar action in the list of Prohibited Substances as defined and/or listed in Uniform Poisons Schedules of the National Health and Medical Research Council'.
Mr. Dillon moved and Mr. Rimes seconded the following motion on co -operaton by the medical pracutoners and drug dependent patients with law enforcement authorities - ''Medical authorities including private practitioners should assist law enforcement agencies as far as practicable in tracking down illicit sources of drugs.
Patients should be encouraged to co- operate with the law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis.
However medical practitioners should not be obliged to make names of drug dependent patients available to Police and Customs authorities.
It was considered that information given to a central authority about patients dependent on drugs should not be readily available to law enforcement agencies as it would discourage patients from seeking and continuing under 8.2.2.
Treatment and Social Rehabilitation of Addicts On a majority vote the meeting decided that all the words after 'discouraged'' in the second sentence of the Working Party's recommendation should be deleted.
The following recommendation was then adopted - (1) Facilities should be organised within the State Health Services and should provide in patient, out patient and intensive follow-up arrangements.
The treatment of drug dependency as distinct from primary prevention is a medical matter, and programmes of treatment by nonmedical agencies should be discouraged.
(2) Legal provisions for the compulsory detention of drug dependents should be made under health legislation rather than criminal legislation''.
The Cbairman recalled that at the previous meeting he had proposed to hand over to Health authorities certain functions now performed by Customs relating to the distribution of narcotic drugs.
The offer had been considered by the Health Working Party and he asked the Committee I to present its recommendations.
Dr. Macintyre stated that Tasmania would like Customs to assist with lnspeculon qduues on a continuing basis, particularly relating to data on narcotics to be sent to the United Nations.
What was needed also, was an administrative means of collecting centrally, data on the movement of both soft and hard drugs, presumably by Commonwealth Health.
Mr, Rogan said he regarded the need to collect and collate data on interstate transactions as urgent but inclusion of intrastate transactions needed more study.
Dr. Wienholt assured the Committee that his Department could cope with bon type or transactions.
He suggested that the terms of reference of the Health Working Party be changed to cover consideration of controls over licit transactions'' rather than ''interstate transactions'' as it was obvious that if the Working Party was to have a continuing function it would be looking at the whole field of control.
The Committee agreed to this amendment and to the following '(1) That a system be set up to collect, collate and disseminate information on all interstate movements of drugs of dependence and that a Working Party be established to introduce such a system.
The Working Party should, at the same time, examine the feasibility, value and practicability of establishing a system to provide information on all aspects of the intrastate trade.
(2) The Commonwealth Ddepartment of Health undertake the collection and collation of information on licit transactions and relevant data to be disseminated to the department of Customs and seise and State AGENDA ITEM 4. REPORT TO MINISTERS n proposed that the Secretariat prepare a draft report to A listers or some S to 6 pages.
This would be submitted to Committee members for approval as soon as possible by correspondence.
The Committee agreed to this course and to Dr. Woodruff's suggestion that the report should contain as attachments a copy of the summary records of the National Standing Control Committee meeting and report of Working Parties.
AGENDA ITEM 5. GENERAL BUSINESS The Committee agreed to recommend to Ministers that the Standing Committee should meet every six months or more often if the circumstances require.
It was resolved that formal sub committees should not be set up but that any area requiring attention should be handled by Working I I a a ATTACHMENT A NATIONAL STAND S OF DE REPORT OF WORKING PARTY ON LEGISLATION The following recommendations were made with respect to the amend- A (a) it should be provided specifically in relation to the possession of prescribed drugs that a drug is deemed to be in the possession of a person if it is upon land or premises occupied by him or is used, enjoyed or controlled by him in any place whatever unless the person proves that he neither new nor had reason to suspect that he had a prescribed drug in his possess- (b) legislation should provide that an offence is committed by a person occupying or concerned with the manage- meant of premises where marihuana is smoked or otherwise used, unless the person proves that he neither knew nor had reason to suspect that marihuana was smoked or used in the premises; (c) a similar, but separate, offence to that set out above in paragraph b) should be provided in respect of other prescribed drugs: (d) it should be provided that a person is to be deemed to be trafficking in drugs if he is found in possession of more than a specified quantity of drugs, unless he proves that he neither knew nor had reason to suspect that he had the drugs in his possession or unless he proves that he was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking.
It should further be specifically prod vied that a court may, in lieu of the offence of trafficking, find the accused guilty of possessing pre- scribed drugs; (e) that those States which do not at present have provision for the fingerprinting of convicted drug offenders, amend 2. The Working Party draws the Ministers' attention to the recomb- mentation made by the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General in 1966 that persons guilty of an offence of importing, exporting, manufacturing, producing, possessing, selling and offering for sale of narcotics without authority should be liable - (a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding 4,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years, or to both; or b) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $1, 000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.
Penalties along these lines were adopted by the Commonwealth in the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 and the Customs Act 1967.
The Working Party noted that the only State in which indictable offences were prescribed with respect to the use of drugs was Victoria and that, in relation to summary offences, the maximum penalty prescribed in Victorian and Tasmanian law was only twelve months' imprisonment.

1.1 Dr. Louis J. Wienholt, who acted as Chairman of the meeting in the absence of Sir William efshauge, welcomed members to the meeting and tendered an apology from Sir William.
Sir William advised that due to pressing commitments during the morning session he would not be able to attend the meeting until after 12 The meeting was advised that the National Standing Control Committee on rugs of dependence had recommended that a Health Working Party be set up, under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Department of Health, to consider - (1) interstate movement of Single Convention drugs and other drugs of dependence: ( treatment of drug dependants; and The Standing Committee also recommended that the Convener should be requested to arrange for the relevant committees of the National Health and Medical Researeh Council to consider and report on certain matters to the first meeting of the Health Working Party.

National Archives of Australia 2. HEALTH EDUCATION Tbhe report of the meeting of the Health Edueation Sub committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council which met 2.1 Matters referred to the Health Education Sub committee The Subcommittee had been asked to advise about educational measures in respect of drugs of dependence and abuse of drugs generally, and speecifieally about the following matters - (i) education of the public at various levels such as - d) parents and other allied groups; (ii) education of the medical and allied professions; (iii) necessity or desirability of publicity campaigns, particularly to counteract undesirable publicity.
2.2 Total programme The Sub- committee discussed the complexity of the problems involved in the education of the various groups in the community in relation to both chard'' and ''goft'' drugs of dependence and reported that in the Sub committee's I opinion there were no simple educational approaches, methods or techniques to cope with these problems effectively.
Problems discussed were in relation to school children, adolescents and young adults and specific groups of adults who occupied key positions in the community as far as education about drugs and the dissemination of information on drugs Were 2.3 School children The Working Party agreed that emphasis should be directed towrards the young person and those who have significant influence over him.
It was considered necessary to promote accurate knowledge about all forms of drugs, to develop discriminating attitudes towards the use of therapeutic materials and to encourage the rejection of the use of stimulants, sedatives and narcotics.
This information should be directed at the child before he enters the phase of experi- mentation, or at any rate, of regular contact with a drug taking group.
All health education programmes should focus on health and the spectrum of related youth problems, including alcohol, use and abuse of drugs, sexual promiscuity and venereal disease, heavy smoking, behaviour disorder and delinquency, rather than campaigning only against drugs of dependence.
It was recommended that - RECOMMENDATION The elements of an education programme about the usages and occeasional abuse of drugs should be set into the general obiectives of a health education programme commencing before the child enters the phase of experimentation.
This would include - (i) Teaching in schools and provision of appropriate text, resource materials and aids to instruction including films and slides.
archives of Australia (ii) Teacher education in the pharmacolo- and social aspects of drug abuse and in discriminating consumer usage of drugs as part of the general health education training programme.
Pre- service training and in-service seminars and provision of teacher (iii) An advisory service to teachers where drug abuse is suspected.
2.4 Adolescents and young adults Although it is inherently more difficult, there is also a need I to provide intensive education about drug abuse for those adolescents and young adults who have already begun to use drugs regularly for non-prescribed purposes and for those who are exposed to high risk.
Education programmes directed at these adolescents and young adults have already been introduced in a number of States in Australia.
The Working Party agreed that these programmes should be watched with interest.
2.5 Medical and allied professions I The Working Party agreed that education should be aimed at the professions to make them aware of the social rills involved.
2. 5.1 Doctors and dentists It was recommended - I The attention of the appropriate education authorities should be drawn to the need for the teaching of social aspects associated with the use and abuse of drugs and partic- ularly drugs of dependence or addiction.
both at the undergraduate and postgraduate I I It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION The attention of the Pharmaceutical Association of Australia and State Pharmaceutical Societies be drawn to - The responsible role which pharmacists play in the community in relation to the distribution of drugs of dependence, education of the public and adequate security with respect to these drugs.
2. 6 Clergy, nurses and social workers II It was considered that these people needed to be informed about the hazards associated with drugs and the most effective methods that could be used to educate people about these drugs.
The Working Party endorsed the action of the Health Education Sub- Committee in setting up a sub committee to prepare an authoritative document for these groups.
nal Archives of Australia 2.7 Officers of Child Welfare Departments and similar organisations The Working Party recognised that officers of these organisations dealing with youth have unique opportunities for contacting particular groups of young people who may be at risk in respect of drugs.
They have the opportunity of influencing these people and it is essential that they should be well informed about the hazards of drug taking and the most effective methods of educating people at risk.
The Working Party recognised that further areas where effective education may be carried out are parent and teacher associations.
The most effective means of educating these groups would be through a series of group discussions led by trained group leaders rather than through didactic lecturing.
2.9 Women of middle age who are at risk in relation to drugs of dependence There is a relatively high incidence of dependence on sedatives encountered in females of middle age.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION The attention of the National Council of Women and other appropriate organisations should be drawn to the problems which are common among women of middle age.
These can often lead to undue use of drugs of dependence especially barbiturates.
There is a need for positive action to be taken by the National Council of Women and other appropriate organisations to assist as many as possible of these women at risk. 2. 10 Training of key health education personnel It was recognised that a need exists for training courses in health education for a variety of health and education workers.
It was noted that dependence on drugs was a specifier area where there was a need for trained personnel in each of the States.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION Consideration should be given to the organisation of a residential training course of approximately two weeks duration for training key health education personnel from each of the States in the most effective educational methods with respect to drugs.
2.11.1 Mass media In relation to a co-ordinated press campaign to counteract publicity it was recommended - RECOMMENDATION No co-ordinated press campaign should be conducted to counteract - (i) sensationalism in the press, (a) There is no means of knowing how the information presented would be used or (b) If the emphasis is too strongly towards prohibition then this may produce the undesirable effect of leading to its refection and the adoption of the very activity which it is intended to (c) Excessive publicity may be generated and some people may see the indulgence in drugs as constituting fashionable behaviour.
The Working Party saw the mass media as useful for - (i) the dissemination of factual material about specific aetiities which are being undertaken in relation to specific groups, and (ii) the provision of positive information about prevalence rates, educational needs, sources of consultation and facilities available to the community, etc.
It was felt that there may be considerable advantage in authorities handling educational activities in relation to drugs having frank discussions with representatives of the mass media when specific problems arise.
2.11.2 Health education films The Working Party noted that through the Health Education Subcommittee information was being collected from appropriate agencies in the States about the methods of using films, production and selection of suitable material for educational Having considered the total programme, the Working Party indicated those areas which they considered most important in order of It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION The following groups in the community should have priority with regard to education about drugs of (i) Teachers, leaders of youth groups and other similar people who have the dual role of disseminating factual information in a desirable educational environment and of detecting at an early stage the potentially drug dependent.
respect to their responsibility in prescribing drugs of dependence.
8. MENTAL HEALTH ASPECTS An extract from the report of the meeting of the Mental Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council which met on 27 and 28 March 1969 was considered.
The Committee considered the difficulties involved in carrying out research into drug dependence including the problems associated with the collection of information and agreed to use the definitions of dependence as set out in the Glossary of Mental disorders approved at the Sixty-fourth Session of the National Health and Medical Researeh Council.
3.1 Matters referred to the Committee The Committee was asked to consider health aspects with respect to drugs of dependence, and advise in particular about the following - (i) collection of information on and research into drug dependence; (ii) education of medical and allied professions; and (iii) treatment and social rehabilitation of addicts.
3.2 Collection of information and research into drug dependence 3.2.1
The Working Party agreed that there was a need for more and more accurate information about drug abuse.
It was noted that the standard collections of mental health statistics was currently being organised in all States in accordance with the programme developed by the National Health and Medical eseareh Council.
3. 2.2 Multiple cause coding of the causes of admission for psychiatries treatment was considered necessary to identify all patients with drug dependence.
In some cases drug dependence would be the secondary and not the primary diagnosis.
Normally, only the problems relating to mental health statistics would be studied by a small referencee committee of the 3.2.3
The list of drugs about which information should be collected was considered and it was recommended - RECOMMENDATION A programme is necessary to collect information about persons dependent on drugs in Schedule Eight of the Uniform curates, and also drugs with similar actions in the list of Prohibited Substances as defined and or listed in Uniform Poisons Schedules of the National Health and Medical Research Council.
Provisions in Commonwealth and State legislation relating to reporting of persons dependent on ''hard'' National Archives of Australia 3.2.5
The Working Party discussed the giving of inform matin about patients who are drug dependent.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION Medical authorities including private practitioners should assist law enforcement agencies as far as practicable in tracking down illicit sources of drugs.
Patients should be encouraged to co-operate with the law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis.
However medical practitioners ghoul not be obliged to make names of drug dependent patients available to olive and Customs authorities.
However it was considered that information given to a central authority about patients dependent on drugs should not be readily available to law enforcement agencies as it would discourage patients from seeking and continuing under treaty 8. 3 Education of medical and allied professions It was noted that a document entitled ''Modern Psychotropic rugs in Medical practice' has been prepared by a Working Party of the Mental Health Committee.
The National Health and Medical Research Council will be asked to approve and publish this document at its Session in May, 1969, so that it may be distributed to all medical practitioners and all medical schools.
A further document for the guidance of the medical and allied professions on the problem of dependence on drugs is I to be prepared by a working party of the Mental Health The Working arty considered that education in drug depend- envy at the undergraduate level could only be left to the Universities but the booklets mentioned may be of assistance in ensuring that the matter is adequately covered.
8.4 Treatment and social rehabilitation of addicts 3.4.1
The attention of the Working Party was drawn to the series of reports which have been produced by the 3. 4.2 The need for separate units specialising in the treaty It was agreed that special treatment facilities assisted certain cases and should be available in each State.
However, many, if not most cases, are best treated in association with the mainstream of psychiatric practice or when physical symptoms predominate, in the mainstream of general medicine.
Special facilities for the treatment of drug addicts and aleoholies are desirable and where they are established it was recommended - RECOMMENDATION tee A Facilities should be organised within the State Psyehiatrie Health Services and should provide in-patient/ outpatient and intensive follow-up arrangements.
The treatment of drug dependency as distinct from primary prevention is a medical matter and programmes of treatment by nonmedical agencies should be discouraged and should not be associated with youth 3.4.4
The Working Party agreed that over a long period, if patients can be supported adequately through frequent relapses, then there is a possibility of therapy being The majority of cases do respond to treatment, even if only temporarily and after care services are con sided essential because of the tendency to relapse.
In most of the sties of drug dependence therapy, there is little indication as to whether follow-up arrangements have been adequate.
8.4.5 Provision of facilities for after care treatment is poor in the Australian States and Territories and needs to be increased greatly within the Psychiatric Health Services.
As after care is the pivot on which successful therapy depends, the Working Party considered that it was essential that provision be made for facilities to enable this period of after care treatment of patients to be carried out.
The Working Party considered there should be legal provisions making it possible to detain persons depend- ent on drugs for compulsars treatment under provisions similar to those in force in all States for the com pulsars treatment of mental illness.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION I Legal provisions for the compulsory detention of drug dependents should be made under health legislation rather than criminal legislation.
I 4. CONTROLS OVER LICIT TRAFFIC 4.1 Commonwealth role The Commonwealth spheres of responsibility were outlined by the Commonwealth Department of Health.
Commonwealth con troll over licit trade in narcotics is embodied in the Customs I Act 1901-1968 and the Narcotics Act 1967.
These controls are administered by the department of Customs and Excise.
These Acts provide for controls over narcotics down to and scalers and exporters are required to submit to Customs monthly returns which provide details of intra and interstate narcotic transactions.
Information in the monthly returns enables the Department of Customs and Excise to administer import and export quotas for the various narcotic drugs during a calendar year; and together with stock balances this is used as the basis of new quotas for the following calendar year.
Under the present system information on interstate disposals down to and including wholesale level could be provided to the States at monthly intervals without any difficulty.
The Working Party was informed that at the meeting of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence held in Canberra on 7 March 1969 it was suggested that certain of the activities of the department of Customs and Excise in this area might be more appropriately handled by the Commonwealth department of Health, although the department of Customs and Exeise would wish to retain liaison with international authorities and be responsible for forwarding to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs the necessary data on licit and illicit transactions.
The National Standing Control Committee also considered it desirable that a service be provided whereby details of licit narcotise transactions could be disseminated to State and Territory health authorities.
A representative of the Department of Customs and Excise explained that his Department had examined the overall situation in Australia concerning licit controls over narcotics with a view to rationalising the situation as at present there is an overlap in controls exercised by the State authorities and his Department.
The Department of Customs and Excise considered that it was preferable to have a single authority handling the licit distribution of narcotics and thus offered to hand over to the State health authorities control of licit distribution including inspection of wholesalers, importers and manufacturers of formulated products.
The Department of Customs and Excise wish to retain the function of inspects ing manufacturers of basic narcotic alkaloids.
Co-ordination a of these activities would be the responsibility of the Common- wealth Department of Health.
The Department of Customs and Excise was prepared to vacate the inspection activities and leave these to the relevant health departments.
It was appreciated that withdrawal from the inspection field may create undue burdens on State health ddepartments and therefore the department of Customs and Exeise has offered to assist and if necessary conduct joint inspections for the first twelve months.
n future data which has customarily been forwarded to the Department of Customs and Excise would now be supplied to the Commonwealth Department of Health in its role as The Working Party unanimously agreed to proposals that licit A controls over narcotic drugs be transferred to Health epart- 4.2 Central Information Bureau on licit transactions The Working Party considered the merits of providing an efficient recording and processing system.
It was suggested that such a system should be reapable of rapidly - (i) isolating apparent inconsistencies in - (a) records of sales and purchases, (b) records of stocks as related to sales, purchases and pre-existing stocks, and (ii) calculating stocks at specific dates; (iii) providing periodic tabulations and analyses of move- and that any inconsistencies should immediately be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.
It was further considered that such a service could not be provided to cover all drugs of dependence without adequate computer facilities and that unless a simple system could be evolved for the collection of necessary input data such a scheme would be so time consuming, complex and costly as to be impracticable.
Preliminary investigation indicated that such data could be collected without creating an excessive burden on various segments of industry and the professions.
National Archives of Australia Al States agreed that provision of information on interstate transactions was desirable, some were also of the opinion that information on intrastate transactions would be valuable.
t was agreed that information be provided on transactions down to and including wholesale level.
ra The vale and desirability of extending this beyond wholesale level was not determined.
It was recommended - RECOMMENDATION 1) That a working party be established to investigate the feasibility, value and practicability of providing a system seminate information on all licit trans- actions of narcotise and possibly other drugs of dependence.
undertake the collection and collation of information on licit transactions and relevant data be disseminated to the Department of Customs and Excise and State Health Departments.
4.8 Proposed international controls on psychotropic drugs The Working Party was provided with a document which detailed the proposed international controls of psychotropic drugs not included in the Single Convention, 1961.
The background which had led to the preparation of this document was outlined.
t was noted that the latest draft of the protocol would not be available from the United Nations for approximately three weeks, but would be distributed to States for comments as soon as possible.

Chief Clinical Officer, Victorian Mental Health Hational Archives of Australia NATIONAL STANDING CONTROL COMMITTEE ON DRUGS OF DEPENDENCE Meeting held on 7 March 1969 SUMMARY RECORD The Chairman, Mr AT, Carmody, said he regarded this as a preliminary meeting, and that another would probably be necessary before Ministers met in May.
The Standing Committee had two main roles, vi., planning action to meet the present situation and a continuing role to keep the situation under review.
The Committee would have to decide if there were going to be sub- ciliary committees, such as Working Parties.
He said that because the function of the Committee was to advise Ministers he considered no Press Publicity should be given to the proceedings.
It was so agreed.
Dr Macintyre said that the Committee's first task was to define what was required to be done to meet the Ministers' wishes, the facilities available in carrying out the Ministers' wishes and the time table for achieving it and what Committees were required.
The Chairman then outlined the functions of the Standing Committee as en- sage Dy tne Ministers.
These functions included consideration immediately of what further steps could be taken by the Commonwealth and States together, to combat all aspects of the drug problem in Australia and to make recommend- actions to Ministers on legislation and administrative action which should be Agenda Item 2-Law Enforcement The Chairman said Commonwealth and State Leglslation to combat illicit raricng was enforced by the Customs Narcotic Bureau and State Ppolice Drug Squads with Commonwealth police having no operational role, being responsible for analysis of narcotise offences in the overall survey of crime As investigactions by different agencles were frequently interwoven there was a definite need for greater liaison at the working level and for the dissemination of all available information to each operative agency.
This type of co-operation was now taking place in New South Wales between Police and Customs and there was a need to extend this on a Commonwealth basis.
Mr Carmody said that he had given extensive consideration to the matter and had come to the conclusion that the most efficient means of ensuring complete co-operation was by the interchange of offerers between Customs and Police in all States.
The information and intelligence records of the Narcotics Bureau would be made available to police and vice versa and combined legal powers could be utilized.
Several delegates requested working details of this proposal.
It was agreed that these would be determined at a later date if the proposal Was accepted in principle at the next meeting after delegates discussed the matter with their own administration.
Both Supt Calder and Inspector Burrows pointed out that they did not consider full time interchange of officers was warranted at this stage in their States.
Future developments could however alter the National Archives of Australia It was agreed that the proposal was deserving of the closest study and that the following recommendation be recorded - The Standing OCommittee notes with satisfaction the offer of the Comptrollers General of Customs to attach a Narcotics Officer to each State Police Drug Suad and to accept a rug uad Officer attached to each larecotic Office.
The committee recommends that States examine this proposal to determine the need for such attachments and their practicability in their respective situations and to report back to the next meeting.''
The Chairman said Ministers at their initial meeting had all stressed the need or a central source of information on both illicit and licit activities.
Such source must collate, evaluate and disseminate data from all sources of offenders and suspects, suppliers, addicts, sources of supply and other allied a matters.
To operate efficiently this central agency should have access to details of the import, export, manufacture and distribution of narcotise drugs and other drugs of dependence.
In addition it should be aware of ship and aircraft movements and have access to records of their crews and cargoes I and details of goods through parcels post.
These were the accepted points of entry of illicit drug imports.
The Department of Customs and Excise exercises statutory contact with I the United Nations to fulfil Australia's commitments under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
Its Narcotics Bureau had established close liaison with corresponding agencies overseas, particularly in South East Asia.
It could therefore successfully operate a central information agency in all matters assessment of crime generally.
No State finance would be required for operation of the Customs Bureau.
es said a Central Drug Bureau was operated by the New South Wales Polio Thig was essentially concerned with police operations and did not include vital data from health authorities.
A forthcoming conference of OCommissioners of police would discuss the matter and could influence any de- casion on the present subject by ppolice authorities.
Mr Emunas spoke of the need for information on drug trafficking to be evaluated as part of the overall assessment of organide crime in astral.
Mr lllon said the establishment of a central drug information and intelligence centre at this time should be with a view to adaptation to computer operation in the future.
Such would permit easy access to the information by all operative groups.
The Chairman said that if the Customs Bureau was to be utilized, the Department would provide telex lines to all police drug squads.
differing opinions were expressed concerning which Commonwealth Department should operate the central drug information bureau.
The following proposal was drafted by Mr Dillon: 'There should be established immediately a National Drug Intelligence bureau to collate and disseminate information to all law enforcement bodies, but when the Commonwealth establishes and has working a Central Crime Intelligence function should be carried out by that Bbureau.
In the interim, immediate steps should be taken to utilise the Bureau within the department of Customs and excise to disseminate operational intelligence on drugs of final Archives of Australia It was supported by the Commonwealth representatives.
It was agreed that this proposal should be considered by State auth- oddities for discussion at the next meeting of the Standing Committee.
Agenda Item 2 3 - Communication with International Bodies The Chairman explained that the Customs department had the existing link with overseas drug agencies.
The Victorian Police had the Interpol contact.
Customs send information to lInterpol through Melbourne.
t was stated that there should be more active participation by Australian authorities including State authorities in overseas conferences and The Chairman said that if effective co-ordination of activities was achieved he I was prepared to recommend that State people be considered for attendance at such meetings at Commonwealth expense.
Agenda Item 2. 4 - Review of Legislation I Mr Edmunds considered that we should look at the question of possession of drugs and the position of the occupier of premises on which drugs are found.
He said that two recent decisions in England had injected a requirement of mens rea into the concept of possession.
Both States and the Commonwealth would have to examine their legislation on possession in the light of these This may be an appropriate area to apply the ''reverse onus'' device.
Although there were political difficulties, if Commonwealthy/ States agreed these could possibly be overcome.
He wondered whether the Committee should consider categorising different drugs with different penalties.
He felt that Ministers would need to say something on this aspect before very long.
In regard to Marihuana, there was a question of whether it should be included with narcotise and what penalties would be provided.
Another important question was whether penalties for certain offences were too heavy or too light and whether there should be minimum penalties.
If the above matters were presented to Ministers as an agreed Commonwealth; State policy there would be a greater likelihood of Mar lames agreed that, with the present mood, minimum penalties could possibly be brought in.
ega suggested that a small working group look at these problems and make recommendations to the next meeting of the Committee.
The Chairman pointed out that the field of legislation was one of concern to both law enforcement and Health people.
The main Customs problem was the need to prove importation.
There would always be some duplication between Commonwealth and State Legislation and this cannot be avoided.
He asked the Committee for agreement on the setting up of a Working Party to consider matters of penalties and other deficiencies in legislation and the Committee agreed to the following ''That a Working Party be set up under the Chairmanship of a representative of the Commonwhealth Attorney-General's department to review possible deficiencies in enforcement and penalty provisions of legislation relating to drug control and to report back to this Committee '' Natinal Archives of Australia The Chairman offered to hand over to the Commonwhealth Ddepartment of health co-ordination of the licit distribution of drugs, with Customs continuing as the national control body for Australia's international obligations, including control of imports, exports and manufacture.
DI Mienholt replied that, if the Commonwealth Health Department undertook this role it would not wish to interfere in State areas but merely to act as co-ordinator, processing and disseminating statistics received from the States.
He considered that the NH and MRC machinery was not designed to do this.
Mr Rogan and Drs Macintvre and Patrick agreed that a central clearing house to disseminate details of interstate drug transactions was desirable.
Mr organ considered that, if the proposal was to include intrastate trade, it would need further consideration.
The Chairman suggested that the proposal be examined and brought up at the next Committee meeting.
The Committee should also put to Ministers what should be done to control amphetamines and barbiturates.
Dr Wienholt, supported by Messrs millon and Rimes proposed that the whole matter be referred to a Working arty on Licit Trade, chaired by a Commonwealth Health representative.
The Working Party would report back to the next meeting.
It was so agreed.
Agenda Item 3,1 The Chairman stressed that the Committee would have to come up with some finite proposals to Ministers on this Item.
Dr Wienholt suggested that the Working Party on Licit Controls look into the problem and make recommendations to the Standing Committee.
It was so agreed.
Agenda Item 3.2 Dr Wienholt proposed that the Working Party on Licit Controls also examine action and publicity matters and consult NH and MR experts as required.
In reply to proposals by Dr Macintvre and Mr dimes on the functions of the Working Party he advised that NH and MRc experts on addiction and health education would be consulted immediately.
The Working Party could hold separate meetings on the different topics if necessary.
lE nOw said that the Mental wealth Committee of the NH and MRC have already discussed drug dependence at three previous meetings without making specific recommendations about its management, nevertheless, it was the body best qualified to do so and its advice must be sought.
A The meeting adopted the following resolution :- 'That a Working Party of this National Committee be introduced under the Chairmanship of the Commonwealth Health Department to consider - (a) interstate movements of Single Convention drugs and drugs of dependence; b) treatment of drug dependence; and That the convenor be authorised to recall together the relevant committees of the NH and MRC in anticipation of the first meeting of the Working Party'.
Agenda Item 4-Need for Working Committees The Chairman reminded the meeting that the question of subsidiary Committees ad peen deferred by Ministers.
He suggested that any recommendation to Ministers should be deferred until the next meeting of the Standing Committee.
This did not preclude the ad hoe Working Parties already set up to report to the Standing Committee.
Other Business Mr lames tabled the New South Wales Department of Public Health publication se and Abuse of Drugs - Information Kit'' and distributed copies.
he Chairman gave Police delegates a list of persons reported as being involved in misuse of marihuana.
n closing the meeting he observed that the Committee had made remarkable progress and felt that the Working Parties would produce tangible Mr Roan on behalf of State delegates thanked the Chairman for his handling of the meeting.
The Committee decided to meet next at 10 00am on Friday l1 April 1969, at the Customs and Excise Conference Room, Canberra.
